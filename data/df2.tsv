True, my grandmother was at home. But I don’t really know. I don’t really remember those days.  I can only remember that she was retired and that my two aunts were at home for a long time before they started working again.  In my immediate family it was not like that.  My dad always worked and my mom always worked.  After they separated, I was alone a lot, because mom had to work a lot, but I really did not mind that much that I came home alone after school and then stayed there alone until 5 or 6 in the afternoon.  That was ok.  It was never that typical picture.  That is not to say that I have anything against it.  What I mean is that if a woman wants to do it, wants to care for the children. When she takes care of everything there, which is already mega help.  What I want to say is that I notice it in my household where we live and where we oftentimes do not have the time to clean and such..and then we have to sacrifice our days off.  No I do not find it devaluing that a woman stays at home.   I think it is a decision everyone has to take for himself or herself.  I believe that being a housewife and mother may sometimes be as much work as a 40 hrs job.  And I really admire those women a lot, which work, have children and are single parents; to manage everything alone must be very difficult.  I know this from girl friends or schoolmates, many of them are already married and have children and they have problems simply finding a job.  Really, who wants to hire a 20-year old with a child which is still small and it is predictable that she will miss work from time to time because of care responsibilities or because the child has a problem.  I believe employers should support people like that and not just not hire them. Something is quite wrong here.” |"

And yes there were daily appearances, very short ones, by my father.  My children, too, grow up with their mother (laughs), and their father, well, visits them during holidays.  I find it interesting and it probably happens quite frequently that this is carried from generation to generation... That meant that I grew up with my mother as a role model, and yes, also with the role model of a father, but that of the father was much less dominant than that of my mother.  What is also interesting is that I joined a sports club, a Swedish sports club, and the members are in the majority women. There are only very few men.  And that was difficult for the women there to classify me.  They apparently have two ready-made assumptions when a guy joins a sports club, which is mainly frequented by women.  For them, you are either a homosexual or after women. It does not occur to them that one is only interested in sports.“ |"

And it was common there that a girl could not sit at the table with the adults, in particular when the table was dominated by men. That meant practically that a girl was not allowed to take a seat at the table or to ask questions, which would have been the worst, because it would have meant she wanted to participate. Yes, but I did it nevertheless quite often when the peasants met, perhaps in a local restaurant, if I happened to be there with my Dad, but also alone nearby, because my relatives also owned such a restaurant, and there I was always asked to get up and help do the dishes, that is to say, to do some housework in order to help my aunt and not sit around idly.   And people who should not really have meddled did that and a quick glance towards my uncle seemed to validate all that.  But I was enormously lucky to have had a very emancipated Dad, because of his mother who was a midwife and managed the company.  That means that his image of women was diametrically opposed (NB: to the predominant views) and he always kept saying that, whatever these men tell you, or whatever anyone says, you are allowed to remain sitting, you can ask questions. And if that is not accepted, just say that your dad told you so, that you can, and that nobody has the right to chase you away.  That way, I was always conscious of my Dad’s protection and therefore could never be really irritated by these people.  That was probably the biggest exception and perhaps I had a well-developed self-confidence, so that I could rebel against that.  And this reinforcement, the positive reinforcement of the role model by my father, made me relatively immune – as a child – even when people kept saying that the way I acted as a girl, always spouting my opinions, I would never find a man"

Also we as women and women have to care for women.  To create the networks between women is very difficult and that is our big shortcoming.  Women do not support women as much as they support men.  Women prefer men, which is a phenomenon that can be observed during election time.  Women do not have the need to be led by a woman and they do not really support them.  But I find that we need women who address these issues.  It is already enough to just have one there; nothing more is necessary.  There is still a lot to do in relation to women understanding women.  We also have to be careful that there are no deficiencies at home.  It is in the majority women who take care of things at home. And in this regard I also have a little story when I was still living in B.  I was at a conference and it was pretty late in the evening and there was this man who asked me what my husband thinks when I am away evenings.  To which I replied that he is happy when I come home.

There were two important things that happened.  The first one was when I was interviewed.  I applied for a very special job for a woman.  The job required working in the field and selling musical instruments.  When I arrived, I met the Japanese boss. The company had just been bought up by Y., a Japanese company.  The Japanese boss was very young and we got a along just fine.  He wanted to hire me.  I did pass all the exams that he had given me, but he said that he needed to inform me that I was not allowed to get pregnant during the first three years working for his company.  That I had to promise him.   That was completely unexpected for me.  It had been my first interview, which had reached the point of considering hiring me.  At first I had not idea how to react.  But then I just said “ok, no problem’” It was also very strange to me to think that I would let myself get hired and then become pregnant.  That was certainly not my reality.  I was 23 years old at the time.  That was not part of my thinking.  I was also confronted with the comparison with men.  He had hired two men and me.  All the other typical professions for women were as secretaries or bookkeepers.  It was therefore an unbelievable novelty for the company that a woman was representing the company in the field meeting all the established traders..and of course, my predecessor had been a man. I found that astonishing, that the boss was ready to try it out whilst elaborating on the difference wanting to ensure that the risk was not too high. It was courageous to hire a 23-year-old woman in the prime of her fertility.but then he needed to minimize the risk.  From my perspective, that was a novel thought.

But my mother asked me why I would chose such complicated studies followed by such a hard job in the field.  She said that one should not imagine to just treating guinea pigs, but there will be cows and horses and such. And she added that it would be really much more sensible to become primary school teacher.  You work four hours per day and the rest you can spend at home.  You have time and if you have family, it is the perfect profession for you.  I did not quite know what to say to that because what I heard did not suit me at all.  Cause I had always been a wild child who played with the boys.  To imagine to address a group of children as their primary school teacher was an absurd thought; far from any imagined reality.  And that was the first time that I was really astonished because my mother knew me, knew who I was; knew my character and my abilities.  I was astonished that she would propose such a job to me, which really did not match my abilities.  I realized then that as a woman we tend to assume the responsibilities for the family.

Yes, that was really the first time  where I started to notice that there are very clear perceptions of how somebody was supposed to be, that women do not smoke in public though these images have changed a lot over the years, but they were very present in my youth.” |"

That happened quite a lot when I was younger, was that there were these stupid sexualized remarks, but also other types of remarks. but I must say.. I come from the countryside where that does not happen that often. But when I moved to B. and then to K. such things started to happen quite frequently.  It happened so frequently that in the beginning, I held up my head high and paid full attention, but stopped all that later on.. That is because one walks along, says hello, but then the answer is verbal abuse or “hi sweetie,” or something along those lines.  When such things happened, I always thought, that I have to react faster, because every time I was dumbfounded and couldn’t react.  People touch you indecently in the metro filled with people and then the person jumps off and there is nothing one can do, or there is a stupid remark and nothing comes to mind to counter it.  Then I thought that I just have to think of something that was at a time when these things happened quite frequently.  I remember this one incident when I was riding a motorbike and a car stopped tight next to me.  The side window came down and I thought that it will come again and I started to scream ‘you wanker”..I was furious ‘cause I thought here it comes again, another lewd remark.  But then I looked at him because I had avoided eye contact at first.. And then he just simply asked where he could find the cinema.  And that was really embarrassing for me.  I thought that this shouldn’t be like that; that I had become like that; that I am this although I am not like that.  So I told this story to a girlfriend of mine when we went out for a drink and once again as we were about to mount my bike, there was this drunk..while I was telling the story..and this drunk asked whether he could join us on the bike.  And I thought, that ok, I am going to be friendly this time, he is only drunk.  So I tell him that it is better to take a taxi.  Then we mounted the bike and were just about to head off, he said: ‘You only want to be fucked, you cunts.’  And then I thought again that I couldn’t be prepared for something like that and that I do not want to be prepared for something like that.  I think at this point I am more quick-witted on the one hand, but on the other hand, there is a part of me, which has given up, since I don’t know.. I would like to be friendly to people and do not always want to anticipate something stupid coming my way.   And when something comes, one can swallow some of it; I just have to risk it, and if I get a lewd remark – in the best and in the worst case, I remain friendly.” |"

Despite the fact that my parents were totally convinced, somehow I never noticed any injustices or disadvantages in daily life.

It also dealt with access to care facilities for children in certain companies, and that many companies, given the lack of qualified personnel, create such facilities in order to attract more women.  Well, I had to present that text and then I had questions, which I had to answer.  And then one woman of the selection committee asked me:’ Yes, Ms H, why do you think that women earn less than men?’  Well, I didn’t think at all.

As the saying goes: ‘one has to marry’.  Then came the second child, the son.  If the first child is a girl and the second child a son, it is only natural to try to form the son according to what one thinks the son should become as a man.  Unfortunately, one discovers that there are limits and that the son will go his own way.  In addition, the son was born in Japan where the son, not as much anymore as before, but still is treated like a crown prince.  But I didn’t want that since that was exactly what my father had expected from me; I wanted to be different from my father and that was not easy and also because of the job.  And so one is prevented to do so; one does not pay enough attention unfortunately.  I know I paid more attention to my second daughter as happens so often.  The pet of the family was more spoiled than the son, perhaps also because my job was very demanding.  What left an indelible impression was an event that happened when the son was in early puberty, around 10 and I was alone with the three children because the mother was not home.  She had left the house and I was attending a conference in China when I got this phone call that I should get a nanny or babysitter.  And because the two girls could play with each other, I tried to get a student who could also stay in the house.  And that was how I got a babysitter mainly for him when I was away for a long weekend or to a weeklong conference in China.  And then my son called me, ‘Daddy, what does he want from me? I want to sleep alone in my bed,’ and that was very shocking for me.  I would not have expected this; I knew the boy; that was my mistake; I did not realize my responsibilities early enough.  I didn’t know the boy well enough and left him alone at home with my children.  And apparently, I will not say that he is a pedophile, but somehow he must have had the urge to lie in bed with my son or whatever, and that shocked me very much.  I then tried to call a friend of mine who I trusted, an old school colleague, who also lived in B.  I asked him to go over there and if possible or necessary, take my son with you and chase him away.  I was very emotional, and my friend did was I had told him.  But I had the impression that my son was very insecure particularly because I had been alone with him over the past couple of months.  And he had been looking somehow for contact, and such contact was given to him, only negatively and that was very shocking for me.  I must say, as a father, being alone with one’s son is relatively difficult to be together in a positive way at the emotional level.  We had quite some fights, then. And it is obvious that as a father one is in a superior position and then it becomes difficult the son his space.  And it is difficult for the son to live out his emotions.  I believe that for the son, the mother remains the stronger emotional centre, the magnet, whilst with my daughters; it was much easier for the father being closer, even physically.  That must have been a troubling experience for my son and I believe it is still with him.  It is difficult to judge in the end, he is independent now and is finding his own way.  But this experience probably also made its marks on me.  Up to then I was convinced that same sex relations are part of nature and that one must accept that. In this case, I was involved myself, and my children and that has an impact and has influenced my relation with the other sex or they way I think about it.  Indeed. |"

I never felt that it was some kind of a handicap, that boys did not accept me. It got better as we grew older. Of course, they called me names but it was a period when we all taunted each other. I taunted others as well. So I took it as that being with girls is my thing to be taunted about. So I was different. But later, after the taunting period was over there was no discrimination. I had interesting collaborations with boys. I was good at faking signatures of parents. So I signed some parental notes and later could have asked other boys to do some physical work instead of me. |"

Men do not deal with, I do not know whether women think differently, that it is great to be at home for three years but at the same time it is a great burden for a woman. This is a deeply rooted stereotype that a woman should stay with a child up to its three years. A child in a nursery is wrong, people disapprove, that you are not able to take care of your child, that a woman should stay at home and take care of it. But there are lots of things that are not considered. On one hand it is OK if a woman is at home. But at the same time she looses, she cannot be a full time teacher, cleaning lady, pedagogue and mother. And a child in a nursery gets socialized, has new stimuli, new... just stimuli. So I think that even for a child it is better to go to a nursery. The best model is to spend a half-day at the nursery to get used to it and a half-day with a mother. A child gets socialized and has stimuli and a mother can rest and she enjoys the time with a kid much more.  |"

When a woman wants to change it, when she act like a woman in a managerial position it is perceived as weak or untrustworthy or inappropriate. That is what I think. And this is a worldwide situation that if a woman wants to succeed in political or managerial positions, she needs to act according to male stereotypes in expressions, fashion, everything. I cannot imagine that a female manager would wear some chic dress, express her femininity. It would be untrustworthy and inappropriate. So she has no other chance than act like a man.

I always considered as normal that if I have a relationship or marriage that we would share responsibilities. And we did. I did not cook much; it was my wife’s task after the wedding. But finally I did not have problems with it; it was me who cooked during vacations. I acted like a woman. But it is again specific and individual. As assumed, and I believe this sort of a pattern is right, that the one who maintains some emotional atmosphere or well-being is a woman. Mutually, but mostly a woman. That is the idea of keeping the family together, domesticity. And my wife had problems with emotional expressions. She did not express emotions neither towards me nor towards kids. Sometimes I felt sorry especially for our older daughter. She had a difficult relationship with my wife or other way round; my wife had a difficult relationship with our daughter. It was irrational; it is difficult to explain. Sometimes it happens that a woman after giving a birth does not bond emotionally with a child. And that was what has happened to her. And I saw it and we often quarreled about it. And that was one of the reasons why I decided that I did not want her anymore. I pitied our older daughter. Sometimes I tried to behave emotionally towards her in order to substitute the role. But it did not work very well.  |"

Because the orientation was about working on farms with cows and so, so there were mostly women. And female teachers as well. And in a mechanic or tractor operator, those where they learned how to operate agricultural machines, there were only male teachers and majority of male students. As I said, I had a classroom only of boys. Sometimes there was a girl on this orientation but rarely. It was strictly divided. But again, it is understandable, I think, it is a different type of work; it requires physical strength and other types of skills. Although, it is true that there is no reason why a woman could not operate a tractor. But girls did not study that orientation, only boys.  |"

When I decided to change a career we discussed it together, I asked her for an opinion and she agreed.

Parents looked at me differently than on my brother. I have an older brother and I can compare. For instance, even now, me being 23 years old, my father worries more about me. I don’t know, If I go to foreign country to travel, he worries that something would happen to me, I don’t know what. It is not that he doesn’t care about my brother, but he just doesn’t worry in such way. This is something, the pressure from parents is different, because I am a girl. They are more afraid for me. And than I think that my grandparents praise my brother quite openly. When coming to his education and everything. Maybe because he is a man. For instance, they never oppose him about anything he does. (name brother) always does everything right. For me it is somehow questionable, while I am a girl. For instance, when I talked to my grandfather the other day, he was very surprised that I am considering to go to postgraduate studies. Why go, shouldn’t I find a job, (name brother) will be the one with PhD in the family. Something like that. But this are maybe really old fashioned variants. ("

Maybe I am again an exception, because I don’t associate so much with my fellow students. I don’t hang out with everybody, I have a few friends and we hang out. But you can hear conversations. For example, a final exam before diploma on department of polish language was very interesting. One female fellow student posted on Facebook. I am convinced about her that she didn’t deserve 9, based on her knowledge she has shown in past 4 years. And she wrote a dialogue from this exam on Facebook and she somehow bragged about it. Again the dialogue was about erotic poetry, it seems that a lot of professors like this kind of literature. I don’t know. Why some poet has so many erotic motifs in his poetry. Well, he really has a lot of erotic motifs in his poetry. It is obvious and if it is on the exam it should be discussed. And then her answer was “Well, because this is something we all like, right, haha.” And then the professor said: “Yes, you are right, hahahaha.” This is something I consider manipulation, flirting, I don’t know.  |"

Ok, the procedures now are also very different, it is done more elegantly. In the past it was necessary to remove the whole breast. But it is like that, cancer, right? A word that is fearful. I don’t know. I was with two women a while ago; one was 28, the other 40. And they were very frightened. And the doctor called me, if they can contact me. And than, after I spoke with them and when they got the information about the disease, their fear went away. I think that talking about it helps a lot. And back then I have spoken to myself. During my workday I went and I had mammography. Or something like that, I can’t really recall. I know I went during my workday and I found out it was cancer and I went straight back to work. (laughing) And my co-worker asks me “what was it?” And I said “cancer.” They were totally shocked. I remember one of them started to cry. And I must say I was fine. Nothing special. I was sure I will get better. That it is quite early and I will get better. (silence) So, I don’t know. And at that time I also considered breast reconstruction. A new breast from my own tissue. And the thought of that was like a psychological crutch. I see that now. For a few months. And it was also helpful for my kids. I know they kept asking me “when will you get a new breast?” But then the thought of that kept drifting away. We were nudists and we are still nudists. At that time I was covering myself up. Well, you can’t be covered up all the time. But I noticed people are accepting me in a way. They asked me “how do you feel? Are you well?” The ones we kept seeing for years. So people taught me. And also kids taught me. When we were with Scouts, I distanced myself a bit, because I experienced a shock. We camped in two groups. And the first group, I had my surgery a month earlier. And I remember I was really hurt by what happened. There were quite a few doctors in our camp and my arm was swollen and on Institute of Oncology they didn’t tell me that this is a possibility. And we were besides the (name river) and I pulled my shirt up and asked one of the female doctors “look, what is this?” “Watch out, children are present!” And I remember I was really hurt.

Because the father didn’t want to hand over his daughter, police (unofficial information state that there were more than 30 policemen) dashed into his house to take away the little girl. There is still no legal epilogue, but the case started a debate in general as well as professional public whether the praxis of mother usually getting the child after the divorce is in the best interest of the child). Yes, sometimes I think that this praxis has no real point in the case of relatively older children. It is too predetermined. And of course children can become some sort of lever to accomplish different goals. But you can’t do anything; it is the way it is.

Otherwise, the passion of my life was singing, but I wasn’t supported. My father never agreed to this passion of mine, for singing. Consequently, one can’t be proficient if one doesn’t study, if one isn’t materially and morally supported by parents or by anyone else. I kept fancying this idea about singing and by the time I was 18 I realized I would no longer stand a chance. And I’m saying this because finally, when I was 18, my father was finally convinced that I had talent and I could do something. And then, at the last minute he decided to get me a canto professor, to prepare for music school. But a series of misfortunes happened, or maybe it was a fortune and certainly now, when I’m a grownup, I realize this wasn’t my vocation in life, making music that is, to become a singer. He spoke to some people for me to take canto lessons and music theory and so on. As it was still the summer vacation, we postponed it for the autumn. In the autumn one of these people that were supposed to teach me got sick. The fact is that in the meantime he convinced me that the moment was lost and talked to me about applying to med school, saying that I could sing after that, that this would be much better for me. I was always a yielding person so I said fine, you’re right, I will apply to med school, since I was already taking lessons for that, so I wasn’t starting from scratch. And anyway, this is how I got to apply to med school and of course, I wasn’t admitted. And then, for lack of a better option, I postponed it for the following year. But in order not to idle around and waste time, I got a job in a technical design institute where I worked for many years after that. It was again my father, who was in charge of my decisions all my life, who said: “you know, by the time you’ll apply to college again, this will help you”. And he said: “here, look, there will be an admission session for a technical vocational school, post-secondary. Wouldn’t it be good if you applied there?” I didn’t like it at all and I wouldn’t have wanted to do it, but I was embarrassed to say no so that he wouldn’t tell me that I’m not good at anything, that I’m not hardworking, anyway (...) I took the exam and passed it, thanks to the fact that I had a very good grade at technical drawing, because I was of no worth at Math, having a background in humanities from high school. (...) And afterwards dad told me: \""oh well, to be honest with you, I didn’t expect you’d finish this school, because it was a field that you were completely unfamiliar with\"", i.e. there were many technical subjects, Maths, Physics (...) And at the time I graduated, I can clearly remember, it was Sunday, we were all having lunch and dad says: “I never expected you to graduate considering you were never taking lessons for these subjects. You know, you could take some equivalent exams for college. You could take these exams and get in to college directly as a sophomore”. “But - he said -  I suppose you don’t want to do this and don’t have the courage to”. And I said “I do have the courage, I was actually planning to”. But I could only go for secondary engineering school. Of course, it was evening classes, since I was already used to it. And so I went to college. I was very proud of myself for being able to take exams and pass them in subjects that I hadn’t even thought I could deal with before. |"

Or he never reproached me that he wanted the blue shirt instead of the white one, which I wasn’t in the mood to iron, for instance. And it was very comfortable. I didn’t really like doing house work, but I did, I had no choice, but I couldn’t say it was the passion of my life to cook and vacuum, but I did it out of conscience. And I figured I couldn’t live in a mess either, nor to let your husband out looking scruffy when everyone knows you, but for me it wasn’t like it was for my mother, she was passionate about taking care of my father, and of the house and wanted everything to be neat, it was the passion of her life, but not mine.  |"

And so I explained him the situation, (I told him) that it was pointless...that I had no kids – it was particularly difficult if you had kids (pauses) and the divorce took a long time. This was the law, you couldn’t. And the thing with domestic violence, we were always summoned, either by the union or by the party (...) Here in the museum we have a couple, a cleaning woman and a handyman and he’s beating her up so badly that he leaves her bruised and no one can stop him. I find it dramatic to not be able to defend oneself, but it is also linked to the fact that the Romanian woman still doesn’t... I am referring here to the average, because the intellectuals seem to have evolved a little, which might have resulted in an increase in the number of divorces. But divorces have other causes as well, so I am only referring to this aspect of unfaithfulness and lack of domestic peace. |"

There used to be kindergartens which our institution belonged to, there was also compulsory medical care. So they (the women) would come here and would receive a consultation or had clinic hours assigned when all employees would go see the doctor and the woman was forced to do the gynecology check-up. Now they keep claiming it was for the pregnancy thing, but it wasn’t only for that...or maybe it was for that as well, to prevent you from...because it was that period when you weren’t permitted to have abortions.

She was working, but she had to give up an actual intellectual career. She’s a librarian and had to give up writing, research. These things could be perfectly true, because once the children grew older, she was to a great extent set free by responsibilities related to them and then she started translating; she’s doing a lot of translating and does so many things besides her career and therefore, she did wonders, also during our boy’s early childhood.  |"

I mean they gain much more rights than women do. It’s not about the wages or intellectual abilities, but in another sense, in a sexual sense it’s definitely differently seen. Men are generally considered heroes when beside their wife they have one or more mistresses, while the woman is considered a whore [laughs].

And then there is a different brand of beer, (Brand 2) that said “no, we represent the real men’s beer, I am a man” and a stand-up comedy type of monologue with a guy saying he’s a man as if he had some issues with this (laughing).

I mean a simple device in comparison to what it exists now, which is used for diabetes, one stage before insulin treatment. Before the beginning of that stage when the one with diabetes is insulin-dependent, there is a less severe stage when you have to take certain medication. It will be released, it’s about to be released, this device that is relatively simple, but for the ones who see it for the first time it involves a certain degree of complexity, if not difficulty – in what concerns handling it, understanding how it works. And she noticed this aspect, in Germany, during the presentation, that all of the people gathered there, people working in marketing, PR, communication, were split in two broad segments, regarding the way they managed to understand the device and how they were handling it: men and women (laughs). Men managed to figure it out in a relatively short time, they managed to open it – especially since, for safety reasons, it doesn’t open very easily, it has certain hidden spots that make it somewhat hermetic and safe, but it’s marked, it has little arrows, it’s made so that you can figure it out in the end. Men catch on almost instantly and they aren’t among those who’ve been in the army and got to open the machine gun. It lasts 30 seconds, and even less to assemble it back.

That is, let’s say, a rather interesting aspect. Other than that, there’s a thing I’m trying to make clear – often when girls hit him, they’re actually teasing. But him - same as all the other boys - when bullying someone, he means it. And in this sense, he could temper himself a little. I mean, they say swearing words such as “you moron, you idiot”, and so on. They even get to more serious matters, while girls often say things like that just to provoke them because they either like the boy and want to tease him in order to make him respond or they hit him, which is a bit more brutal – they pinch him, snap him with the ruler, but without meaning any harm.

I think it’s easier and more pleasant to communicate with a woman, to interact with a woman, rather than with a man who is less empathetic. At least as far as I’m concerned. So, yes, I believe in a woman HR expert stereotype. I think it’s the same for spokespersons, or anything related to communication. Meaning, I believe women are much more capable to communicate certain things than men are, and they’re also more reliable, they seem more sociable, I don’t know, everything related to communication – they’re more intuitive in what concerns their companion’s moods, they know what to do in order to smooth away prospective aggressive instincts and so on.  |"

In my 8th grade I had pretty good grades, so I could choose almost any high school I wanted in my hometown. Therefore, I wanted to make a compromise, the natural sciences compromise, which was part of the science field. It was a compromise between the real science class – Mathematics-Informatics - and Philology or Social Sciences where I wanted to go. I particularly liked History, not so much Romanian Literature. And it was some sort of compromise after long debates with my family, after I realized it might be much easier to find a job if I went to a science class rather than a humanities one, and so on. That was about it, so it was some sort of compromise. Natural Sciences are somewhere in the middle – between science in its pure form and Philology. (...) Hard sciences offered me more opportunities, so I was set to follow that path. As I mentioned before, I believe it has to do with gender. |"

Even if the implicit assumption about women in politics is that “who knows who they slept with to get there”, I believe that now things have changed for the better. But I still notice this similar thing to that fieldwork research of ours. When I was with a male friend in the bus, discussing politics, something, I don’t know, some piece of news, we were commenting on it. And an older guy on the bus told him in awe that “you will become a great man!”. And it was as if the hope in the new generation and politics needs to be supported by guys, maybe also in this context that “the youth is emigrating and we need someone to stay here and take care of things”. And I believe this is rather oriented towards the male population, that you need a man with a good image, who is still a bit paternalistic, with an iron hand.  |"

Maybe they are not written out in such a clear and lucid way, where it is enumerated what belongs to a father or a mother, wife, husband, but these spheres somehow clarify themselves. They position themselves. They have their own significance, their order and also in my house or in the upbringing of my children or in partner relationship with my wife, there is a position of a man and a woman unequivocally allocated. For instance, it has its simplest correlation to the fact that my wife is a pedagogist by education and both of my daughters, humanists by education, have never approached her asking for assistance or explanation in respect to the issues concerning maths, physics or chemistry. By assumption, these subjects were somehow mine. It was known that it was me who knows this stuff. Similarly to the thing which is the most natural and which requires maybe not men’s competence but some strength or knowledge of things that results from the fact that one does it often. I think about such household works, purely household works as, I don’t know, the blind broke, a tap is leaking, the internal part of the washing machine, the drum does not want to spin. Or suddenly, the pressure of oil in the car decreased. All this is addressed in a natural way to a man. Whereas, I don’t know, when I cannot find something or if there are no – it’s never the case in my house – clean shirts left or something else is missing, of course, these issues are addressed towards a woman, towards a wife.  |"

I had done the HAVO section of secondary school, so that is preliminary to a HVO level study. That was much too easy actually. So I also did VBO, then I did HWO and when I was 20 I was already teaching. I was a crafts teacher. I thought: ‘Well, this is NOT it!’. So I went and studied again, I went to university. What influenced that decision? One of the motivating factors was the fact that I had a boyfriend at the time. He was horrible. He always said: ‘if you can’t explain something, you don’t really understand it!’. So he was really into knowledge! So in fact this stimulated me very much. So he was really condescending towards me, because he thought that I was"

And I know that partly this was because I knew he would not play a big role in raising the child. That is a very rational logical calculation I think. So obviously it is love and you don’t just randomly pick a man. It was a man of whom I thought: ‘I would want him to be the father of my child, he is a loving man.’ But as a‘parent’ I didn’t think he was up to the task and that is very normal in the Caribbean culture. People always have children from several fathers and fathers sometimes play a role in raising the children but more often don’t or hardly do. So, that was ok in that context. It worked a lot better than if I would have chosen to do this in the Netherlands because in the Netherlands, the men demand their fatherhood or their role in raising the children. Men in the Netherlands say: ‘I don’t want a child unless I can participate in raising it!’. So"

So it is very much dominated by women. And as you move upwards towards the secondary school and university, they are a lot less represented. There you have a lot more male teachers. What I have noticed is that the primary education is very much oriented – because of that – towards girls. For example, I had a female teacher when I was about 10 and if we were going to do something nice, than it would be picking berry’s in the woods and making jam or making cookies or ginger bread when St. Nicolas (local children festival) came. And that was what the whole class was supposed to do. And of course, for girls this is really their thing, this is what they like. But I also remember that when St. Nicolas had come (he brings presents for the children at night, just like Santa Claus), the day afterwards all pupils could bring their presents to show to the others.

You know, this one doesn’t want to do this job, the other does not want to do the other task, even when they saw that I took his place, in his stead, they sort of did not really accept the situation, in fact one of them told me once 'listen, we salesgirls, you are a salesman, sort of, you do the same tasks like we do', and I had told them 'listen, he asked me to take his place'.

We brought them up as we could with the help of God, they got married and anyway I was the last one left at home and I remember I then told my mother 'now my siblings are all gone and I still feel the desire for a religious life', but then the Lord wanted otherwise, then I remember I attened a theology course at the Domenicans for lay people and exactly there I met my present wife, I mean it’s a long story about how she also felt she wanted to do the same course and from there we met and now we are married and I have a seventeen year old boy and I thank God we are happy, beautiful life. |"

She worked in Malta, so even from that point of view, it was not a question that she could accompany me easily, but also because we considered it to be a temporary situation, it was not worth moving the children around. So we took that decision. If I had to think about it a little bit, had it been the other way round, that the opportunity arose in the case of my wife, I don’t know whether the same thing would have happened, that she would leave for a year. I don’t know because it did not happen, but I can say that especially because of the children, they were both small, I think that even on her part I think she would have resisted going abroad and leaving the children behind. The factor that I can tie to is my experience, of the family, there is a very strong tie between the children and my wife. I also have a tie to my children, but, as a result of certain experiences that we had when the children were very small, I think that that tie that my wife had become stronger because they had gone through a problem so there was a stronger tie. |"

I remember I had registered for a course in education, and the manager there often used to tell me 'listen, why on earth did you choose teaching, wouldn't it have been better to become a lawyer?' Now I think there was a link with the fact that teaching very often was considered to be a female profession. On the other hand, it could also be an important factor in those days that a lawyer - I think also nowadays - are better paid than teachers.

The reason was, he said, that he needed me and he told me 'either you come and work with me or you go to university'. Now in those days I wished to go to university, but I did not wish to take law because he wanted me by force to do law. Now the reason was that all my sisters had been to university; they had gone through law, but in the end changed course (...). And anyway, I told him that I was not prepared to do law and so he told me 'so you have to go and study photography abroad to learn it as one should', and he sent me to (place) (...) When I returned back to Malta and I joined my father in his photography shop, he obliged me to do as he liked - not my ideas, what I had learned - so we ended up not agreeing at all. When I then met my present wife, who was my girlfriend at that time, and our relationship was getting serious and we were thinking of getting married, my mother had asked him 'listen, he’s the man of the family, he must provide for his family'. And my father had to take a decision about how he was going to allow me to be the boss of the shop or I would leave. And that was the first important step for the shop to adapt to modern times, because my father’s tools had been in use for thirty years - when today a tool, a camera, can’t be used for more than a year, you have to change it. That’s his usual mentality (...) Yes, my sisters could do whatever they wanted because they would get married. They will become mothers and so they don’t have to provide for the family and so they could make their own choices. In my case he wanted the name of the family to continue, he wanted the business to continue, because he used to work for his father and so he expected me to work for my father (...) I mean he didn’t allow me 'listen, I don’t want to become a photographer', no. 'You have to because this is a family tradition' and he expected it to continue like that. What also happened was, to be honest, that at the time when I left school... You might remember, schools were being closed down, we did not have the opportunities that children have nowadays (...) and so naturally when you don’t have a pleasant choice, you think it would be better to work for your father because you think it’s easier. But in reality it’s worse. But what makes sense to me is that I don’t want my children in the shop. The shop has a set deadline that when I’m sixty-five (because we retire at sixty-five) the shop will close down. I mean, I do not want my children to continue. There are two reasons for this. One because technology in our field is changing and we’re going to be phased out. I mean, I don’t see a future for it. For me it’s fine because I can work for the next twenty years, because people will continue to get married, certain work will continue to require photography, but not enough money to earn.  |"

So about two years ago. And I said 'let me do an experiment and go and live with someone else'. And I had two friends, men of more or less the same age as me, and I went to live with them. And there, I did not feel too bad in the sense that we were three men, so certain elements did not crop up. We had our own spaces and if we want to keep it in disorder, we keep it in disorder, but that was your space and we respected each other’s space, right? I mean, there I was rather happy too. Then came this other bit. I mean about a year later it happened. About a year later I went to live with my girlfriend. I mean, we went to live in a flat together and there I started to become aware of the real difference between a woman and a man. Already my mother, since I was small, had started to give me the idea. But you say that’s because she’s my mother not because she’s a woman. You think that mothers are like that, not women are like that. And then we started... We started... For example I, when I sleep, I always had wanted to lock the door, but no: she wanted to keep the door open. So we started with this many... (...) She wanted everything in order, my jacket, even if I use it every day, she always wants it kept in the wardrobe. I cannot leave it on the sofa because she says that it creates disorder and everything. And the plates, after we eat, she wants them cleaned immediately because otherwise they create disorder and it makes her feel bad. (...) Both things were making me feel bad, both when she asked me to put things in order and also when she touches it. But most of all when she touches it. But the biggest clash was when she touched my things. Let us say otherwise a little quarrel and that’s it, but then I got really very angry because I felt she was invading my space and I sort of told her 'look at it from a practical point of view: wouldn’t it be better for me to leave the jacket there and as I go out every day I put it on, rather than I have to remember and then forget, and then I have to go downstairs again to get it, I go upstairs again', and a lot of this. She told me 'no' by force because she always wanted order; this thing that she always wants order. Even my mother had always the same, almost fixation, with order. (...) Try to understand: from my part as a man, I can speak as a man, that this is my space, right, and if I want to leave a book open on the table that’s mine, this is my space. And I think that when there is a place in total order, it becomes sterile, it looks dead. It’s nice for people to live in a place with some disorder. (...) And it was a difficult period until we agreed that she does not invade my space in order for me to understand, until she understood that I need my own space and she understood that I was not going to change up to the point that I was always going to keep everywhere spick and span because that is not me. (...) I think it influenced me in the sense that I understood better what she wants and I understood better how important it is for her, the need to keep the house clean. Because it’s something on her mind that order gives her a sense of relaxation. I used to discuss this experience with her and with other people too, and I observed that the women always said she was right and the men rather said that I was right (...) I think there is this difference between women and men in the sense that the men again appreciate the practical aspect of things; a woman looks more at what appears. I don’t know, the aesthetic element of things, maybe the aesthetic for a woman is more important than practicality. For me, being practical is more important. (...) |"

So when I was about nineteen years old, there was this friend of mine, she was my friend and we used to discuss at length because we were very close friends.

She decided to part with him and she used to come to talk to me; not because she needed advice but because she just wanted to speak her mind, (...) open up to me because she was feeling bad and she was not sure whether she had taken the right decision. Now I used to observe this in other women too. (...)  She used to follow her heart, to follow her emotions, not her intellect. And she continued to suffer for months. On my part, I can see that men reason with their intellect, not with their heart, while this particular friend had let emotions take over almost completely. She went on suffering for months, because she continued to see him and then he refused to see her and this was very difficult for her. But then, at one point in time, I could no longer listen to this story. (...) I told her that when she decides to use her intellect and place her reasoning before her heart, then she will stop suffering. Before you do that, don’t speak to me again. I mean, I was tough on her, but it was for her own good. In fact, after about a month she stopped altogether. (...) I don’t know to what extent I had influenced her. I don’t know. It could be that she realised, but I told her what I wanted to tell her. As for me, I can tell you that she helped me understand women better; that you have to be prepared to appreciate that part of the woman that, how shall I say, that her heart rules her mind, sort of. You have to give her time; to give her time to first do that transition between thinking with her heart and thinking with her mind. I think that for a woman, it is more difficult to go through that transition from thinking with her heart to thinking with her mind. I think for a man... At least, let’s say I don’t find it so difficult. That was my first experience for you. |"

The same as when I was at my mother’s house. Even if there is some maintenance in the house, in my house, I have to do it. (...) Always. Because he says... Because he has got his day at work. To tell you the truth, he does not even clean and put away the blade and the brush he uses every morning to shave. He leaves them there for me to clean and put away because I am at home. Because a woman’s work at home, I feel, is not at all appreciated by a man. My husband says that he would do everything in half an hour if he were in my place. I always tell him show me how to do that and I’ll follow your example. Till now, after forty-five years of marriage, he has never showed me. To tell you the truth as well, something which hurt me when we were getting married (...) My husband started looking for a place where to live anyway (...)

But my husband, because an apartment was rented for five pounds less per year, he decided himself that we would live in this apartment for twenty-two whole years.

When I was given the new duties, I was given an office. And most of my colleagues were men. There were smokers among them. They would also allow other smokers to come into the same office to smoke. Now, the Maltese law had already been enacted that smoking was not allowed indoors in public spaces. In fact, I was feeling ill with the smoke. Not just psychologically, but also physically. I was having health problems because I cannot stay in smoke-filled zones. I was a smoker earlier on in life, but when I realised that my health was in serious danger, I stopped smoking completely. And as much as possible, I don’t stay near a cigarette. So, I made a report to my senior officer, who was a man. Now the smokers were men. I want to emphasize that it was because of the fact that I am a woman, my word was not taken into account. The smokers were believed, but not me. In the sense they did not believe what I said. They put my word into doubt as to whether my colleagues were smoking in the office or not. My Director told me to phone him when they started smoking and he would then come to verify. When they started smoking I phoned him, but my phone call was never answered. In fact, when my colleagues saw how serious I was, not only because smoke is bad for my health, but because it was my right to work in a smoke-free office...  We were working at the law courts. I was at the law court and that’s a place where the criminal was respected because he had his rights. And I was not a criminal and my rights were not respected. Excuse me, I also went to the ombudsman but nothing happened. I went and wrote to the Director. I remember I had even found ashes on my computer, and I took photographs of that and I sent them to the Director. He did not even send me an acknowledgement. Nothing. In fact, then I started looking for another job because I felt like I was pushing my head against a wall. I had even asked the Union but I received no support. I mean, they came, they sat next to me, but it's their word against mine. Because I’m sorry, because they are men, their word counts. And me, because I’m a woman and fighting something on my own, no one believes me.  |"

At the head of the table sat my father, facing him my brother. For me, that’s not fair because I’m the oldest.

I feel that certain things should be equal, if anything, because my brother is capable in some areas, but I am capable in others. You understand? Not that I have limitations. I don’t blame them, you know, because probably that’s how they were brought up and they didn’t know otherwise. I don’t blame them. But as for me, to go back to domestic issues, it is so important that this is not something for the woman only. It’s for both. Because today, independence... When you grow up... (...)

So there has to be that time gap until he entered prep 1, because prep 1 in those days was after year 5; not equivalent to form 1. (...)  Also when I was at home, why... I mean, for example when we wake up in the morning, why do I have to make the beds and my brother does not have to do them because that’s not his job? Or why me... For example, my mother had a fixed time-table: on Tuesdays and Fridays, she cleaned the house - why was it that I had to help her wash the dishes in the kitchen and my brother did not have to? I mean, he was allowed to watch television for instance. He was not pushed in this aspect. Today I think that maybe this thing was useful to me in the sense that I grew up to be more independent, to have more initiative - something which my brother does not have in his character. I mean in that sense it was positive. But in those days, it used to store up a lot of anger inside me. (...) Something which really bothered me when I was small, was the way my parents treated the gender differences between us. To give a few examples, one of the things that really made me angry when I was young was that my mother expected from me help at home that she did not ask from my brother. For example, I remember my mother had a very fixed time-table for housework. For example on Monday she washed the clothes, on Tuesday the floor, Wednesday was her day off, on Thursday she washed the clothes, on Friday she again washed the floor, etc. And Tuesday and Friday were the days that I really hated for the reason, apart from the cleaning, that it meant also work for me, when for instance I wished to spend my time doing other things. But I used to understand and I wanted to help her. And then, for example, for some time my brother and I we slept in the same bedroom, and she used to ask me to do the beds. I used to do both mine and his, and he did nothing. And also when I grew up and they gave me a new bedroom, she used to expect me to do my bed as well as his. And the same thing when it came to dusting, for example, I had to dust my room as well as his. So now I had even more work, not less. And she expected that I do the dishes and dry them and put them away. And I remember my brother in front of the television doing nothing. Nowadays maybe that’s been useful. Today if I had to compare my character to my brother’s, I find that I am a person with a greater sense of initiative, maybe more capable in practical things. We grew up differently. It could also be that my parents saw in my character something more liable to work and so they trusted this work in my hands... But I still say that it was all the result of how my parents viewed the role of a girl vis-a-vis that of a boy. Something which I also remember, an episode which had really angered me, was when I menstruated for the first time... I don’t remember my age exactly, but I think that I was about twelve years old. And I remember my mother had explained the facts of life related to this episode and she told me \""now this evening we will go and visit grandma, grandpa\"". And I remember we did go and there were all her siblings and she informed them that I had menstruated and they congratulated me. And they told me to be careful and so on and as a girl of that age, the thing that I remember most - apart from the fact that some things I did not understand because I was still young - but I felt that she had invaded my privacy as a girl. And I had felt really bad and I remember I had spent the whole night crying because of this. Probably something which she never discovered. Let’s take my brother and all the men: when they experienced puberty, no one in any way got to know and it passed by without anyone noticing it. But unfortunately, a girl has to overcome this step to show everyone that she has become a woman, that in reality is part of the natural process of life. (...) They never pushed my brother to do certain things for the future, except his studies, but I remember they used to tell me \""study to become a teacher because that is a good job for a woman, for a housewife, when you have a family, because then you will have the holidays with the children\"". As if there was no other nice job that I could do in future. And in fact, that is what happened. Because I became a teacher. But not because they pushed me, but because it was a career that I really wished to do and that I loved; and I’m not sorry to have chosen it. (...) |"

And anyway, when I told my friends about it everyone looked shocked, as if I had done a very grave error, like I had lost my dignity, very serious, like I had put myself to ridicule. You know what’s it’s like to lose your dignity. I had shown that I was desperate. My friends told me that in these matters it is the male who has to take the first step. (...) Obviously this had affected me greatly, because when you are sixteen these matters affect you deeply and your life revolves around these matters and this really made me close up within me.

Later on, when I got older – the last years of secondary school – my niece and nephew became real friends and then ithappened that my sister – I have a sister – that my sister got along so well with 3 of my nieces and me as well, but they always walked together and I followed behind. They went to play ‘spy’ with the 4 of them and so my sister went to my aunt’s house to play spy  and I wasn’t invited, poor me (smiles). And then they went on holidays a couple ot times. At a certain time they even went to the USA and my sister could joint them and my aunt – who is rather rich – paid everything for my sister and poor me couldn’t go along. At home we are not very... we are not very rich so my parents are no travellers. So, being able to do a trip, for me this was: ‘waw, a trip to Corfu’, or some other destination. My sister could join them a couple of years ... What was I going to say about this?... |"

But it never worked that way. You still feel it. At a certain point – when must that have been – my eldest daughter was thrown out of her house. I said: ‘hold on! What is going on here?’ She still lived in town A at the time, so I went there. Well, she had a boyfriend and her mother didn’t like the boyfriend. In the mean time my ex-wife had married again and also her new husband didn’t like the boyfriend. So, I talked to my daughter, she was working already at the time. She had not studied a lot, but she was adorable. I said: ‘Ok, so I will take the responsibility, let’s look for an apartment!’. I knew her boyfriend because also his father came from the same town as me. My daughter and (future) son in law showed me a letter written by my ex-wife in which she said that she couldn’t marry the boyfriend because he was not prestigious enough. That same son in law has been the director of a bank for the past 10 years, so that is not too bad when it comes to prestigious! And saying this to her daughter who had only gone to school until she was 14 or 16 with some extra schooling in French, is not very wise. We found an apartment and arranged everything and I told them that I would sign for the caution. And then there was a change again when their first son was born. So, it wasn’t that she had to get married, but when the son was born all of a sudden my ex-wife wanted the party at her place, that was the only time that I have been to her place. She doesn’t live too far from here. So then it changed. And so the daughter and son in law- because by that time they had married – were welcome again. From that moment my relationship with my two other children got a lot better as well.  |"

That is what you hear afterwards. When you are a lot older, you realize that your father never bothered about those things. When he retired he didn’t even know how much he earned. Because my mother – in those days they used checks – she took it to the bank and paid all the bills. She gained a lot of authority and that was considered normal. I think it depends on the character, but maybe also because I was the eldest son? That was another difference: a daughter was being married OFF TO, she would leave the house. Whereas a son, he would bring a wife into the family. It used to be that way on the farm and those agricultural traditions continued to stay alive long after the farms were gone. The mentality persisted. And you still often hear: Outwardly the men is the boss, but if you close the front door, the women is the boss.  |"

I think that for the rest of my live I looked for a Joop Ter Uil type of women! I don’t think I chose those books because of their literary qualities, but surely they gave me some insight into the feminine world. I just want to say it was: ‘Joop ter Uil in love’, ‘Joop Ter Uil engaged’, ‘Joop Ter Uil married’ and ‘Joop Ter Uil as a mother’. I read all of it. Also ‘Stijfkopke’, that was an analogy, based on the same theme. That was our only access to the women’s world. Yes, and I can remember, where we were living, in the bathroom. On Saturdays we would take baths. There was a big metal tub that was filled with hot water from the kettle. First the little ones would take a bath, then they got a biscuit and cup of tea and had to listen to the radio. Than the bigger ones took a bath. But that was very strict. I think I never ever saw my elder sister – an even my younger sister for that matter- naked. Never in my life. It also didn’t matter. That was the way things were. I think it was part of the upbringing. You didn’t even want to see that. It was such a normal part of upbringing. You are in two different worlds and those worlds meet."

The housework and the chores have always been something that I experienced as naturally being shared. (...) And I should also say that the strangest periods I had were without my dad, who went to work for a while in Paris. He was away during the week, and I found myself left alone with my mother. I found this very strange because in the end my father looked after me just as much as, if not more than, my mother. (...)

I don’t think I had any preconceptions about the sexes and identity that you could link to activities that belonged to one sex or the other. I always experienced it like that. But on the contrary what I know for a fact is that my father often used to get teased a bit – in a nice way, a nice way – by other men because it was his wife who earned the money, which frankly he didn’t mind a bit, but given public perceptions at that time (...) it was something which wasn’t looked on very kindly or understood very well.

Of course we are still discussing the famous question that women between 25 and 35 have been asked from time immemorial – whether they intend to have kids. Which, between us, is completely stupid since a woman between 25 and 35 years is obviously much more likely to have a child than (a man). (...) What's funny is that discussing the subject you get reactions that are sometimes completely ... crazy. One of the reactions that struck me the most was a young woman saying to me in the course of a discussion: but it is clear that as a young woman I have much more risk of having a child. So having a child is a risk. And for once I said to myself: I am lucky to be a guy. (...) but where she should say it is a chance to have a child, she spoke in terms of risk. And somehow the explanation is quite simple, it is indeed the ... break which she will face in her career that may prevent her from progressing as she wished. She does not know what will happen when she comes back. (...) in terms of recruitment. Well people develop questions and attitudes specific to the sex of the person they are confronted with. In their CVs, people say that they have children, they are living together, etc. It is not absolutely necessary legally, but they do anyway. (...) and then because she is a woman and she says she has children, we will ask her how she organizes childcare in the evenings. And with a man who comes for the same job and who also has children, they will not even ask the implied question: as a woman it is you who look after the kids. Which when you look at the reality remains a fact, no doubt. But it's still funny - well funny I don’t know - but it's crazy to say to yourself that if someone has children, you will ask him how his wife organises things. If you're a man, you will be left in peace on the subject. The assumption is that it does not even concern you. I think one way or the other it is worrying. This goes back to what we were saying earlier: as a man you're not allowed to have emotions, you have no right to look after the kids, either. This is not your area. This is not your thing. (...) I get extreme reactions regarding stories on women's recruitment, I get guys who explode, and women too. Men and women who just explode and say: 'I am not paid to do family planning.' (...) I think that the economic situation, the world we live in, mean that we are quite capable of giving this type of subject a legal framework, but I think that at as regards individual cultures, we are still light years behind. |"

Perhaps with a woman I’m more reluctant to allow myself that type of contact, and if I were a woman, I think I would face less of a barrier to do it with both (men and women). .

But there’s no need to start hitting, especially as, well, in the majority of cases it’s the man who is going to come out on top, so it’s just too easy, it’s just too easy. If there are physical conflicts, it is more entertaining if the opposite is beefier I think ... or you set it on a playing field that's normal; but you can not use physical superiority; and in general you start hitting when you have no more arguments anyway ... it's a big problem, unfortunately cases of battered women, abused women even in their relationship, we all know some, I've known some, it is a disaster. I think in Belgium it’s one woman in seven who has been abused somehow or other – not always outside, most of the time inside the couple or in the family – and that is a real regret. I think that [sort of] man is a cretin. You absolutely have to get enough education and to work on yourself to avoid that, to really avoid it. You find this violence at all levels of life. Me, I have two children. My son is four years older than his sister. (...) [She says] “Sometimes things blow up and he goes to hit me and I can’t do anything about it because I’m little, I’m four years younger than him, and I’m a girl.” I try to explain this to the lad and he says “yes well she called me all sort of names.” I say it doesn’t matter what she calls you, you call her names as well, but once you start using force you know very well that she can never answer you back, because she isn’t strong enough, so you have the advantage. Not only that but you’re older so you should be a bit more mature. (...) Obviously it’s easier to be violent inside the family, because there are no witnesses and you have a psychological hold as well. (...) I think a huge education and teaching work should be done at this level, to contain [violence] and to make people understand that violence does not bring anything, anything ... and if one has energy and aggressiveness to sell, then one should practice sports and find other ways to express themselves, but that never solves anything and considering the work I do, I can see that the French language is deteriorating here in Wallonia and the lack of knowledge of French causes problems of violence, because regardless of grades, spelling is deteriorating, kids do not read anymore, whatever the knowledge of the language, the knowledge of the language of instruction the one in which we expressed daily, if I can’t put my ideas into words, get my arguments across or have a large enough vocabulary to develop them, when a conflict develops everything comes to a sudden halt and I have no way of expressing myself – so what do I do? – I hit out. Hitting out is the reaction, so I think a much deeper level of French learning, at least for us on this side of the border, could avoid lots of physical conflicts. |"

For example he was allowed to attend an English school for 5 years, which was quite expensive, while nobody was thinking of investing money on me. Moreover, they bought a lot of books to my brother and not to me, and they ended up with telling me that I didn't like to read. The truth was that nobody was reading any books to me, we had a very different treatment; he was good at school while I was a dunce, but probably this happened as I was quite left to myself and I had to take care of myself alone and that was why he was smarter and more committed to studying. |"

As she herself had lived a tempered life she was not able to be generous with me, to make a gesture that could have emancipated me, saying 'I had a very hard life, a sad one, and now I would like that my daughter could be free and happier, less troubled than I was'. She contented with what she had, she didn't make anything more than what she was expected to; frankly speaking I didn't find it fair to be castrated myself, when living in a completely different context; this was while I reacted and revolted; this conflict that arose with her was due to her lack of intelligence a scarce attitude to understanding. And this discrimination did not hit my brother as my parents used to say 'he is a boy while you are a girl', and he was allowed to go out and had more money to spend. At the end they confessed that they gave him much more money than me, not because of his being a man, this was not explicitly said. I think my mother had a gender problem.   |"

When I went back home at lunch my parents already knew about it, that this guy had stopped me in the street, I went there quietely and sat to have lunch and I realized that there was my father, who usually was not there at lunch and my mother told me 'with whom did you talk today?', 'what do you mean? with the ones I talk to everyday', I answered and then my father said 'Look, I know everything, you'd better avoid to say that you did not talk to anybody, a boy came by car and stopped you'  etc... I was astonished, then he told me it was one of the teachers who was his friend who had seen and immediately told him, so this is one event; this guy continued  to go round our house by car, he was a bit older than me, as there was a roundabout, as he hoped to see me and to meet me,  so one day I was upstairs with my grandparents and we had been talking for I while, I was lying in bed as I said my grandmother  was paralysed and so I was lying in bed beside her  at a certain point my father was coming back from the fields and he saw him, he saw his car, and probably thought 'she is upstairs, that’s for sure, and she is probably staring at him by the window and she agrees with...'. Then he came upstairs and entered my grandma's room, he thought of I was pretending to sleep and he slapped me, and my grandfather tried to stop him and said 'what do you want? why are you doing this?' Knowing my father, he was not the one who was used at beating his children, he never beat us, that was the first and only time he slapped me and he answered: 'it's because she was at the window and there is this guy going around and I don't want to have such situations...' , then my grandfather told him: 'Listen, she had been lying in bed with us the last hour and a half', then he  was hurt and told me 'I'm sorry, please forgive me, but I saw this guy going around and I was disppointed so before going and take him, I came to you, I believed you were at the window'.

It was the only moment when  he took part, or on friday evenings, it was a party for us, as he arrived and children jumped on him, they were so happy, and he was always available, the time was not much but when he had time he was quite available. I can tell you an event: he had this passion for billiards and on saturday afternoon he went to play, not always as, I told you, he was working, and one day I told him 'if you'r going to continue and go to play billiards on saturday I'm gonna change the lock and you're not going to enter home anymore, as I am fed up, I understand your working out of town, working on saturday morning, but when you are free on saturday afternoon you have to stay at home with your children'. From that day he abandoned his billiards stick and never went back to take it, then you see he is quite a reasonable person, but there are situations where one has got a passion and would like to develop it, as he really liked it, but he didn't object; at the beginning he was shillyshallying 'well, just sometimes, etc..' but then he saw I was determined, he renounced. At the beginning he was trying to insist 'I only have one single hobby' and I told him 'You have only one single hobby but I have a whole week hobby to take care of the children by myself and so if you are here on saturdays, either you have one hour or two, you spend them with us, and the children, you cannot tell me  'I'm going out 3 hours to play the billiards', I cannot not accept such conditions'.  |"

And here again it is significant, because women and girls, married and unmarried women work there, because I’m telling you there is a difference, not big but it’s still there, either when we fold envelops or folders, in whatever work we do, yes, the work done by a woman looks more beautiful, yes in such fine work, because these are fine work after all.

Even if I had wanted to become a hair-dresser, or whatever, I could not stand for long enough to do that, so what remained for me were vocations where I could sit. At that time I was not 100 percent into it, but I needed to choose something, you couldn’t stop studying after eight grades, you shouldn’t do that, so I thought then “let me try to become a tailor of women’s clothes.” My attitude was that I would do my best and then we would see if I could do it or not. I was lucky because in the eighth grade, at the end of the school year, when we were over the choosing of secondary school and the graduation ceremony, because, by the way, I attended school among healthy people, and there were no prejudices, they were nice and they accepted me, there was no problem with this. And when we had to submit our applications to the secondary school, then I asked the head of the class “where could I go? No matter how much I want to be a hair-dresser for example, I could not do that.” And then it was me who said, “sewing,” but I had no idea, I grew up in the countryside, I didn’t know what opportunities existed, and then the head of the class was kind enough to have a look and researched this opportunity at the boarding school, which has changed its name since then, it used to be called (name school), and you could learn various trades there, and you could get a high school diploma there, there were workplaces there too, I mean workshops within that building, and then I got into this vocational school, where the teachers came to teach from other regular schools, all right. When the exams came, then we had to go out and take the exam in a different school but when we took the final vocational exam, then the committee came to our school same as with other schools, I think with seven members. There were the same conditions as with quote-unquote “healthy” people, seamstresses; there was no difference. Only that the machines were altered; for example I roll the machine with my elbow, but those whose legs were not that bad, used their legs. And I think that this vocation, this is definitely"

This was suspicious. Now my parents took me to the doctor to ask for help, there was no problem with that, as I too as a parent would have done the same. However, the doctor told them that it was a simple operation and he suggested he do it. But I could walk; only I put my legs crossed. So I did not put my legs side by side but crossed. I did not fall though, I just walked that way. He said he would correct that and I would be able to walk normally and I wouldn’t have any problem. Now what happened is that he cut the main nerve in both of my legs and I lost my balance as a result. And from that point onward, after they had removed the plaster, then they brought the wheelchair for me to sit in. I was only four but I protested. And in fact I learnt how to walk by myself. This was very interesting because the first time it took me two hour painstaking effort till I managed to stand up but I succeeded. I was holding on to the wall and tried to walk very slowly. ("

Sometimes my older sister did the housework too, but not too often because she was more into books, was always reading, and I myself, because I really liked my father, I always had the feeling that my father should be able to eat when he gets home. This was my primary goal, so it was not so much for myself but rather this great love of my father, this was what motivated me; this is the way I can put it, that if there was somebody who loved their father, then this was me, I cannot even put this in words. My feeling was that I had to thank him for everything, also the fact that I have become such a person, the way I am.

That is, until that point, things he had never done, he started doing with this babygirl – the baby was around 2-3 months old when they took her in the family. And of course, there is the element of a Greek tragedy of fate, that is, they had wished for a girl but it was always boys, boy, boys being born and finally, with the death of their son, they get a girl. This well-built, I can say, big man, suddenly starts talking about how you need to change the diaper for a babygirl, how carefully you need to wipe her buttocks and put the cream on, because a babygirl is much more sensitive than a boy, and what you see, what I see is that logically I relive my own gender roles, and my status as a man among men in my own village comes to mind, so what is really interesting is"

So, what was powerful for me in (Name1)’s story is the human dimension of the whole thing, if you like, the literary or artistic dimensions. And in this sense, of course, when one is confronted with, or perhaps not confronted, but if one compares one’s own choices with the choices of a different community, then they are always in a certain sense questioned, or confirmed, or they are confirmed by the questioning. And indeed I was not shaken in my choices, which were, and I repeat, not so much gender roles, but sure, if we really want, we can say that there are gender roles, according to which I do certain things in the division of work in my family and not the other person. I am sure there are many things that I am less likely to do; for example I do not sew, I do not mend my socks, or clothes, so there are things that I leave for my partner. Although in my first marriage there were many things with the children, like washing and ironing the nappies, this I did as much, or rather more, than my wife who was a judge at the time. So these things were not taboos, they were not forbidden in my world beginning from my twenties, and in my own social milieu, consisting of mainly neighbours and friends who had a university degree, these were totally accepted and normal things to do for a man, so I can say that I lived in a micro-world, I lived in (name city3) for 10 years, where these were self-evident and natural things for all the men of my age. The same thing was not natural or self-evident even for my own male relatives of the same age as mine, or the members of various Romani or non-Roma Hungarian communities living in villages. I’ve always had the impression that urban intellectual culture or habits preceded these communities’ habits by one or two, or even three decades.  |"

And yes, I think that if there are many men and many women in a community, then indeed it is easier to have these rigid male and female roles. For example if there is a big wedding celebration and there are thirty women who cook the soup, the cabbage, make the pasta and do a myriad of things for the 300 guests, then it is crystal clear that there is the female chorus who do all these and there is the male chorus who cut the wood for the fire, make the fire, build the tents, slaughter the pig, and I could go on, so in certain situations society operates on cooperation that is set up according to skills, knowledge, physical strength, delicate work or needs. When there is a family of four, then this is not a mass, so there is no possibility for male and female work there, of course everybody brings the knowledge of what would be if there was a big community here, 200 people, or maybe just 20, so perhaps if there had been two girls in our family besides us two boys, then perhaps things do not have turned that way that I would do the dishes, well first i wiped the dished, then I washed them, then I cleaned.

So, I start looking around, I take classes in theatrical play for children. In one of these seminars, after it was over, I met [name of woman], a future colleague of mine, and we started doing children's parties, and I found work that way. One day [name of woman] calls me up and tells me that they need a man animator at the museum and that it's good that I'm a psychologist because it is a museum for emotions, and they need a man, who is also a psychologist and an animator. Difficult to find all three together. All three pieces are important. It was important that I am a man since they were looking for men, and having also a psychology degree and previous experience with children on top of that made me feel confident, sure of myself. I felt safe because I knew there wouldn't be much competition because one doesn't easily find men in this profession. If I were a woman there would twenty others waiting behind me for the same position. The director of the museum said it was good to have men animators because children need to male element as well, they need female and male models. I liked this. |"

I told her, the one doesn't exclude the other. You can take him to karate and to theatrical playing as well.

I went there and am really happy that I did. It was quite a positive experience. I believe I could have joined, even if it would not have been as obligatory as it is in practice. However, I am sure that the fact that I am a man had an impact on the issue, as men tend to join the service in Finland. I think it is quite good (that men do it). I am quite sure that if I had decided to do the civil service instead of the military service or if I had dropped out, I am sure that I would have heard comments about it afterwards. I think it is wrong that you can make a comment on an issue like that, as it can be someone’s own free choice. However, it is clear that if 95 per cent of your male friends join the military service, your father has completed it, your brother has completed it, it is clear that you also think of joining. At the end, I am really happy that I did it, because it was a good experience. However, if I had omitted the military service or if I had dropped out and chosen something else, I think even today it could have been considered as untypical behaviour for a man. People might think that it is not the way a man is supposed to behave. I think that a great part of those who join the military service want to at least try it, because men tend to complete it in Finland. I think it is part of the role model offered for men. It is being argued that the military service turns boys into men. I believe it does in a way. You learn to behave there, to lead and to be in a group. I think the military service is a masculine thing but in a good sense. However, in my life I have met men who think it is not a masculine thing to go there. On the contrary, they think that if you wanna go, you can go. According to them, gender is not an issue there but my opinion is that it is. Equally, there are many women who would like to try but do not have the courage, as they think the atmosphere there is very chauvinist, as it actually is - as it is a male community.

Whe have proceeded so that I will first go to the sauna, maybe with another woman, if there is another woman in the group by chance. After that the men will go. Many more men will go. In the smaller women’s group, we start to eat and maybe discuss. It is quite gendered to spend the evening like that. It makes it difficult to create contacts, I would say. Especially in Finland, where many agreements are concluded in the sauna. That is an example that there are barriers as a consequence of culture and other factors. One cannot do much about them but of course they have an effect on experiences in working life and on the career progress. If you have a good personality, you can do well in the work life in any sector, at least in Finland. Especially if you are dealing with men in a sector where the sex ratio is fifty fifty. I think that I have had to work more than the men in order to advance in some way. In general, there is a perception that all men have technical skills or are technically talented already when they are born. When a woman gets a task that she is not specifically trained for and she has to become familiar with - for example a task related to I.T. that is very technical -  I think that as a woman you have to work much more in order to gain competence and be credible in that.

I think my dad did not like it when I was not very thin first. In the beginning I was, like around the age of five, but after that I was too fat according to my dad. I got an eating disorder. First I had anorexia and then bulimia but then I did an exchange year in (country a) and there I recovered. I returned and decided that these stupid things will end now, I will start doing sports. I had just done jogging before. I had not gone to the gym or done any sport that would have been encoded either male or female. Jogging is something that everyone can do. But then I started the body pump as one of my friends went there. It is gymnastics done with weights. It is a really girly thing, no boys go there. My father never realised that. When I started to go often to the body pump, I became somewhat muscular, especially as I had a bit of weight. I had recovered from the eating disorder and gained weight and become a bit muscular but that was not good enough (for my father). He commented on that saying “don’t go to the body pump, that is not feminine to have muscles. Soon you will become a bodybuilder”. I tried to explain that no I won’t. It is impossible, even if you go there 8 times a week. It is an endurance sport. But my father did not like it. A while ago he had an opinion that I am anorectic and too thin. Nothing is good enough for him. I don’t know how this is related to womanhood but he has this picture in his head that you cannot have muscles nor extra kilos. You cannot be too thin but anyhow you are supposed to be. Nothing is good enough. |"

Like when I was young, my mom always told me that when she was in school she could only move up to the next grade conditionally because she was so bad at maths. She told me how bad she was at maths and how she never knew any maths and how she had to be in remedial instruction. Somehow I thought that I am also very bad at maths as my mother is very bad at maths. In general, the attitude of the people is that girls are not so good at that. In fact I was always very good in maths but I was also very interested in languages. In high school when we had to choose between a more demanding maths course and a less demanding one, I still chose the more demanding one. However, I had also chosen two languages at a more demanding level, German and English. I thought that I had no time to put effort in studying maths and my grades went down. As I didn’t put effort in studying maths, I decided to leave it out and concentrate on studying languages. One of the maths teachers thought that maths at a more demanding level is not a subject girls can be good at. I think this was one of the reasons why I didn’t have so much motivation in learning it anymore. The teacher had this preconceived idea that you cannot keep up one's end. As I also had some sort of preconceived idea that I most likely cannot make it as my mother didn’t make it either, I thought that maybe this is not my thing after all. I concentrated on studying languages in high school, which led me to the university to study languages. Maybe I could have become a maths teacher. I think that learning maths has always been fun but at that point keeping up with the advanced level maths course was too much.  |"

Even if my parents didn’t pressure us to share household chores, we, both me and my brothers, soon were educated in an environment where chores were shared. We were in charge of cleaning our bedroom, of making the bed, of helping clean the house. Moreover, my brother was in charge of cooking. All this comes from my older sisters’ pressure or influence. My oldest sister, who is 10 years older than me, was finishing her studies in college when I began doing this sort of chores. In my position as the sixth child, well, sure, I had four sisters. I guess all these things have a crucial impact on the fact that there was an equal distribution of house work. And that this wasn’t discussed. Sometimes there was some sort of a debate.

If you loose a case by one vote, this doesn’t exactly invite anyone to take parental leave at all because you always know who will be blamed for loosing a vote. This is also why you see many European parliamentarians taking their children with them to work. And when I put this story forward, I often experienced that folk they were sort of thinking that maybe it was because I was a woman that I would think like this. I tried to suggest that this may be more of a general attitude. That’s something I noticed in general that when you discuss gender equality"

Because from the biological point of view, something slightly different is expected from each parent, and both roles are important. Whereas I believe that we could easily dismiss this differentiation between men and women in many other areas, in this case, I think it is a meaningful difference. |"

That’s a Czech specificity: we have both female and male tenses and since this female form does exist in Czech for a specific working position or activity, I think that it should be used. So I did refuse to sign this contract, and I must say that those women at the human resources’ department, were quite astonished, because I convinced them with factual arguments, that they had to rewrite this contract, so that it would correctly refer to my working position. |"

As far as it concerns professional career I agree. But you cannot have equality in all domains. If a man travelling can hold 2 suitcases, he should not expect a woman to carry a suitcase of 40 kilos! This is not equality. This is a matter of courtesy. Men should be polite. First of all, equality must exist in professions but there should be mutual respect.  This means to respect the other according to their existence. It is not acceptable for a man to walk 10 steps forward and the wife and children to follow, like in old times. Or it is not right to say the man can go out and have fun and the woman should stay and do the housework and raise the children. Even in the area of relationships, men used to be free in having relationships with women whereas it was not easy for a woman to have a relationship if not married. In my view this depends on how the person feels. If he/she feels that they found their other half ok. But I would not judge a woman who had a couple of relationships before getting married.  If it happens, it happens. The same goes for men. There should be mutual respect and love between the couple. After marriage I cannot forgive cheating. It is lack of respect and love. It is better to say that you cannot be with the other person, whether you are a woman or a man. Both men and women can be free in this respect but always having mutual respect.  (...) |"

He said 'ok son'. He gave me money and asked when I was coming home. I said 'I don’t know' and he said 'ok, 01:30 be home'. Then my sister wanted to go out too. And they had an argument, because he said no. At the end he said that she could go out as long as she was with me and he told me to look after her. As if I were her father. I had to escort her whereas I could go alone with my friends. And when I became 18, I never told him when I was coming home. I used to tell him not to wait for me and I left. If my sister said something like this I don’t know what would have happened. She would get locked in her room.

But, I had no serious discrimination in comparison to my brother, who is 5 years older than me. The only discrimination came from my grandmother, the older generation.

This complaint concerned a woman who claimed to have missed a promotion because of her gender. When I went to see them, although they had been informed in writing, they were very surprised to see a young woman working for the state.  Their negative attitude was a combination mostly of the facts that I was a woman and that I was young. The important thing was that I was representative of the government and they were 5 men above the age of 50-55 and I had to sit and talk with them. Their age was important because it is at this age where men underestimate women the most, in my view.

The situation I remembered, but it’s not the only one, is when I was in the mountains hiking last summer, and there was a slope which was especially tough, and my advantage being a man then was that I managed to go up very fast, faster than most of the people in the group. I left my backpack on the top and I went down to get some other people’s backpacks, actually, I took the baggage of one girl and I went up with it. And of course, this is a very limited notion of what is male and female, but it is a starting point because the genders are mostly defined by the starting point, which is the body. When we start from the bodies, the first difference is the external one, that is, the external difference in the shape, in the body shape. And of course, it is debatable if it is a physical advantage, but this is a part of what makes a person a man or a woman, this is very conditional, but let’s say that in our culture, in the West, this is in a way the image of the man, who is physically strong. But nowadays somehow this is changing, this is not necessarily a sign of what it means to be a man. Or maybe in a sense, it is falling off. And of course, not to forget, the purely physical strength is not necessarily a part of the, so to say, identity, that is, the power of the body can be a part of having a male body, but does not necessarily mean that this person builds his identity precisely on this quality, that he turns it, in some sense, in the thing that defines his gender.  |"

In the interview that took place at the workplace, the employer was interested whether the person who would work for him has both the physical capability and the qualification, whether the person would be able to cope with the work. And the work of a vet is harder – physical strength is needed, not only knowledge. And among the three candidates, the man was chosen – that was me. So in this situation, it was not about experience and qualification, it was more about whether the person can cope with the work, the way the work is.  |"

So we saw some gypsies, and she went to them and asked them where the block that we were looking for was, and they started explaining some things amongst themselves. Then one of them came, obviously the oldest of them and the leader. He came straight to me and explained to me what she had asked them. Obviously he thought we could settle it “like men,” he did not trust that she could understand him, so he came to me to explain to me where the block was, and I had no initiative to talk to him in the first place. |"

It turned out that the field is dominated by women. For example, there were only 5 to 10% of men there, I cannot count precisely. And with time, most of the boys gave up and moved elsewhere. The only boys left were some who were very talkative and sharp-tongued, some who were more open than me. And the rest were only girls. And I have noticed that it is mostly like that in the Humanities in education. I don’t know if this is due to the fact that more women choose to study for higher education, and men try something else, or because men emigrate in an easier way, I don’t have any clue to be honest, but definitely this is the case everywhere, this is my impression, in the Humanities field. But recently I heard, I have heard often about girls who study Pneumatics and Hydraulics in the Technical University, and I would have never thought that there is even one girl there. |"

With them everything was very strict in the very standard way, the patriarchal model. My grandfather was always doing the things that require more strength, the mechanical work; my grandmother was cooking, cleaning. He was never dealing with these things – cooking, washing the dishes, this is very standard for the old times. For example, I can say now that I try to do some of the things, which used to be seen as typically female tasks and I also expect that the woman I live with would do some of the other things, as much as it is possible. Not to have things separated according to this principle, that it is simply a man’s job and that’s that, or that it is a female’s job. I do not see this as very practical. But specifically because of my father’s case, I try to learn as much as possible about the things he had not taught me, just because he did not deal with them, he could not do, but I try after all"

We lived together. But I saw that I am the stronger of the two and that I can do more and from then on"

Because you cannot share this with everybody. Neither with your family, and I was married, right, you cannot share it in the family. Nor with a friend, or a colleague"

The girls have these illnesses because this is something internal, as in the metaphor with the sexual organs, girls take everything inside. And actually I was missing some kind of a stability inside the family, something, to which I can hold on, never mind if it is good or bad, and it is not like I have grown up on the streets begging or in the most horrible environment. The lack of this attention from my parents has made me cope with things by myself, but I have not been clear about it because after all I was a child, so I had to cope with things based on what I was seeing in advertisements and on TV. Because where else can you get this information? There was one book at home called “A Book for the Woman,” which was a socialist book from 50 years ago. The only thing that I remember from it is something like “masturbation leads to marginalization.” And that girls who masturbate are expelled from society, that it is something trashy and really bad and I am not completely sure that this idea has disappeared from me. Because in this age, during this maturing, you leave behind the children’s things and you start slowly walking towards adulthood. That is why it is very important what you will see and what will get in your head, since this is what you will keep for your adult life. Years may pass before you realize that what you kept from this period is wrong. That is it, years have to pass, you have to live through different things, different situations, different relationships, and different people, so that you can realize that what you had as concepts initially is not what you believe in yourself and is not right for you, and you just have to leave it eventually.  |"

The father – drives the car, makes the money and changes the light bulbs, and is powerful and responsible and defends everybody, and the mother in the normal families should be a real woman, use make up, know things about cosmetics, go to depilation, have manicure, look good, cook and clean the house and take care of the family. And actually I started noticing that my family is precisely the opposite – my father stayed at home all the time, after all that happened. He stopped working and was just staying at home and cooking. My mother was driving the car because my father had problems with the eyes, and she was making all the money in the family. She used to have and still has very rough hands, which are not like a woman’s hands, and she has never gone to manicure, she does not use cosmetics; I cannot use her clothes because they are not too feminine; or at least that is what I thought before. And in some ways"
