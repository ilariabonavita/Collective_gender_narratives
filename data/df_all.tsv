True, my grandmother was at home. But I don’t really know. I don’t really remember those days.  I can only remember that she was retired and that my two aunts were at home for a long time before they started working again.  In my immediate family it was not like that.  My dad always worked and my mom always worked.  After they separated, I was alone a lot, because mom had to work a lot, but I really did not mind that much that I came home alone after school and then stayed there alone until 5 or 6 in the afternoon.  That was ok.  It was never that typical picture.  That is not to say that I have anything against it.  What I mean is that if a woman wants to do it, wants to care for the children. When she takes care of everything there, which is already mega help.  What I want to say is that I notice it in my household where we live and where we oftentimes do not have the time to clean and such..and then we have to sacrifice our days off.  No I do not find it devaluing that a woman stays at home.   I think it is a decision everyone has to take for himself or herself.  I believe that being a housewife and mother may sometimes be as much work as a 40 hrs job.  And I really admire those women a lot, which work, have children and are single parents; to manage everything alone must be very difficult.  I know this from girl friends or schoolmates, many of them are already married and have children and they have problems simply finding a job.  Really, who wants to hire a 20-year old with a child which is still small and it is predictable that she will miss work from time to time because of care responsibilities or because the child has a problem.  I believe employers should support people like that and not just not hire them. Something is quite wrong here.” |

But they are close to my heart because it is about my family.  I became a father and decided to fill the role completely.  I live with my partner and when she was expecting, we decided together to fully share the responsibility for the baby.  I work 32 hours per week and can manage.  Well, today there is a bit of stress because the kid is sick.  But we’ll manage. |*| 2 | Yes, indeed, to fill the role of a father, it does take a bit of support; no I do not mean money necessarily..well.. of course money is essential; but no, I am thinking more of infrastructures..laws.. the likes. Unfortunately, it is still the case that the majority of parental leave application comes from women; perhaps they do simply earn less than men. The things I appreciate a lot are the Viennese parent-child centers’; they do and help with about most everything – concerning parents and children.  I was a little bit skeptical in the beginning and so I went with my partner. she was preparing herself for the delivery. And yes, when the baby was finally there.. We were really happy about the people at the parent-child centers’ and how they had helped us. they advised us..how to organize our daily lives with a newborn*| *|  and then I showed up a couple of times with the baby (NB: alone).  Those who work for the centre are very nice and like to help.  The real first problem was the other parents..the mothers.. reacting to me.. ‘cause there are not many of my kind.   What I want to say, they reacted to me, parents, and fathers who wanted to fully participate, not just one weekend, a day or two.  No, I wanted to experience my child and what helped us where infrastructures like the parent-child centers. But then I remember showing up at these centers, the other mothers looked a bit perturbed. like what is this guy doing here; he does not fit.   It is really difficult to escape the male role.  At least in the beginning.. Nobody takes you seriously.  But I got accustomed to it and can take it very well. |*| 4 | (R): As a matter of fact, it felt quite natural to me.  True, men can decide; women cannot; they have to live with it.  I wanted to have the experience of participating in my child.  That is tremendous and so fulfilling.  My parents weren’t role models; that is certain.  Though my mother did support me. I must confess that circumstances had changed.  Way back then, it was different.  Now we have companies with child care centers.  You - cannot compare that to the past – such infrastructures just did not exist.   A lot has changed.  On the other hand, I do get angry from time to time about the new legislation.  I believe that there are a lot of men who would like to be partners on an equal footing.  The new structures help here.  My friends helped and so did my employers. |

That there were no fathers over several generations on my father’ side, that my father grew up without a father who had disappeared before his birth.  I grew up with my mother.  And yes there were daily appearances, very short ones, by my father.  My children, too, grow up with their mother (laughs), and their father, well, visits them during holidays.  I find it interesting and it probably happens quite frequently that this is carried from generation to generation... That meant that I grew up with my mother as a role model, and yes, also with the role model of a father, but that of the father was much less dominant than that of my mother.  What is also interesting is that I joined a sports club, a Swedish sports club, and the members are in the majority women. There are only very few men.  And that was difficult for the women there to classify me.  They apparently have two ready-made assumptions when a guy joins a sports club, which is mainly frequented by women.  For them, you are either a homosexual or after women. It does not occur to them that one is only interested in sports.“ |

And it was common there that a girl could not sit at the table with the adults, in particular when the table was dominated by men. That meant practically that a girl was not allowed to take a seat at the table or to ask questions, which would have been the worst, because it would have meant she wanted to participate. Yes, but I did it nevertheless quite often when the peasants met, perhaps in a local restaurant, if I happened to be there with my Dad, but also alone nearby, because my relatives also owned such a restaurant, and there I was always asked to get up and help do the dishes, that is to say, to do some housework in order to help my aunt and not sit around idly.   And people who should not really have meddled did that and a quick glance towards my uncle seemed to validate all that.  But I was enormously lucky to have had a very emancipated Dad, because of his mother who was a midwife and managed the company.  That means that his image of women was diametrically opposed (NB: to the predominant views) and he always kept saying that, whatever these men tell you, or whatever anyone says, you are allowed to remain sitting, you can ask questions. And if that is not accepted, just say that your dad told you so, that you can, and that nobody has the right to chase you away.  That way, I was always conscious of my Dad’s protection and therefore could never be really irritated by these people.  That was probably the biggest exception and perhaps I had a well-developed self-confidence, so that I could rebel against that.  And this reinforcement, the positive reinforcement of the role model by my father, made me relatively immune – as a child – even when people kept saying that the way I acted as a girl, always spouting my opinions, I would never find a man*| *| . |*| 2 | (Continues telling about her happy marriage which has already lasted 15 years) |*| 3 | ..It went even as far as.. that my Dad gave me strength to withstand my mother’s role model. That meant that my mother had very clear opinions. That I should attend an agricultural school in order to learn ironing and cooking.  I hated that from the very outset, but according to that, I was destined to become a primary teacher because it was a job that could be easily combined with family, where the summers are free.  But I never wanted that.  I had a second reinforcement in the family. That was my mother’s sister who also less studied and never held a high opinion about such schools even though she herself had attended one.  She was therefore trustworthy.  She said to do what you like doing and cooking and ironing are things you could teach yourself if you had to.  That meant that I had a second ally.  And my Dad had always urged me to go the way I wanted to go and never expected me to follow a certain direction.  In this way I had a counter point to my mother who still has it in her head, and that will never change even though she may see that it can work, but it hasn’t worked for her, that is sure.” |

(NB: ambulance service) and that really presented a challenge to me in the beginning, in particular as a woman, to hold one’s own.  I can safely claim that I am a good driver most of the time (laughs).  It’s always been that the people who drove with, that is men who were part of my circle of friends never said that I was driving horribly; most of the time they complimented me how good a driver I was.  But then, as soon as they were back with a group, they would say that women don’t know how to drive and that they would not want to drive with me. And there were people there who’ve been driving with me before, but when they are part of the group, they don’t say anything against it.  They participate in this charade, that women do not know how to drive.   Honestly, that is something that has always upset me.” |*| 3 | (R): I got upset and screamed at this friend of mine, telling him that he’s been often  enough with me driving a car, that he should know that I am not a bad driver. But the reaction had nothing to do with what I ahd said. They just continued to make fun of women and that they don’t know how to drive*| *| . |*| 4 |*| *| Thereare advantages working as a woman in the rescue service even if one has to listen to all these sexist jokes on a daily basis.

I do not feel insulted by it; no, I just think, I know this about myself that I can handle such jokes, because I am used to them.  But I also believe that it depends on who one is or how one takes it.  Perhaps if one is a housewife, just as an example, who likes cleaning and cooking, I might feel insulted and put down for what I like doing; that I am ridiculed... But still this is expected of women, that they can cook, that the apartment looks nice and of course, women are not allowed to neglect themselves.  Women’s beauty has to be perfect, always.  I believe that is must be exhausting to assert themselves under these conditions.  I myself have never experienced anything really malicious, but I have heard about it, about a professor at the University, about whom people said to avoid his lectures because he does not like women*| *| ”   |*| 7 | R. continues to talk about this professor who, for example, does not allow women to sit in the first three rows because they could smell of menstrual blood. |

But I insisted and argued that kids should have equal rights and that it is against the law that boys are being excluded from Hip-Hop just like girls cannot be excluded from football.  Finally the school gave in and it was the first year that boys were allowed to participate in a Hip-Hop class. |*| 3 | (R): Yes, yes and thanks goodness, the mother, too.  We both said that it couldn’t be possible that the kids, that is the boys..we did not understand why it should be a purely girlie activity.  I probably wouldn’t have intervened if it had been a sewing course (laughs), but not allowing boys to participate in a Hip-Hop course, that I didn’t quite understand.  And one of my sons participates in such a course, but he is being criticized.  It was not only difficult to get the school to accept, but also his classmates.  Schoolmates have difficulties in understanding why a boy would want to participate in a class with 10 girls.  That requires a lot of self-confidence on the part of the children, to do that and admit that they like it. That’s it.” |

That is something I found out for myself and I would not want to miss a day of my life and at each crossing there is more to learn and everybody has something else to learn.  Also we as women and women have to care for women.  To create the networks between women is very difficult and that is our big shortcoming.  Women do not support women as much as they support men.  Women prefer men, which is a phenomenon that can be observed during election time.  Women do not have the need to be led by a woman and they do not really support them.  But I find that we need women who address these issues.  It is already enough to just have one there; nothing more is necessary.  There is still a lot to do in relation to women understanding women.  We also have to be careful that there are no deficiencies at home.  It is in the majority women who take care of things at home. And in this regard I also have a little story when I was still living in B.  I was at a conference and it was pretty late in the evening and there was this man who asked me what my husband thinks when I am away evenings.  To which I replied that he is happy when I come home.  I suggested to him to ask his colleague what his wife thinks when he is away most of the evenings.  It wouldn’t hurt to look into that side a bit more.” |

There were two important things that happened.  The first one was when I was interviewed.  I applied for a very special job for a woman.  The job required working in the field and selling musical instruments.  When I arrived, I met the Japanese boss. The company had just been bought up by Y., a Japanese company.  The Japanese boss was very young and we got a along just fine.  He wanted to hire me.  I did pass all the exams that he had given me, but he said that he needed to inform me that I was not allowed to get pregnant during the first three years working for his company.  That I had to promise him.   That was completely unexpected for me.  It had been my first interview, which had reached the point of considering hiring me.  At first I had not idea how to react.  But then I just said “ok, no problem’” It was also very strange to me to think that I would let myself get hired and then become pregnant.  That was certainly not my reality.  I was 23 years old at the time.  That was not part of my thinking.  I was also confronted with the comparison with men.  He had hired two men and me.  All the other typical professions for women were as secretaries or bookkeepers.  It was therefore an unbelievable novelty for the company that a woman was representing the company in the field meeting all the established traders..and of course, my predecessor had been a man. I found that astonishing, that the boss was ready to try it out whilst elaborating on the difference wanting to ensure that the risk was not too high. It was courageous to hire a 23-year-old woman in the prime of her fertility.but then he needed to minimize the risk.  From my perspective, that was a novel thought.  I had never imagined that it took courage to hire a woman at that age. |*| 3 | (R): He wouldn’t have been able to do anything about it.  According to the legislation then, he could have fired me after my maternity leave.  The question was so astonishing for me, because this scenario was not at all part of my thinking or planning.  On the other hand, the whole story had something discriminatory.  He said he liked my qualifications, that they were excellent and that he would like to hire me, but that it is tricky to hire a woman and that hiring a man would be more practical.  He also demanded a double loyalty for his courage.” |

I therefore accepted the mother’s initiative to assume those responsibilities.  She did complain and was unhappy. The whole thing was quite contradictory. |*| 2 | (R): These new legal possibilities to assume the full role of a father did not really exist during my time.  My children were born in the 70’s or later.  My individual behavior could best be described as being unconsciously structural-conservative.  I wanted to be left in peace and not be bothered with such things as children.  I certainly was a traditional man in that respect.  But the contradiction between behavior and propaganda and that which one supports, that I was clear about. |*| 4 | (R): Yes, for sure.  I tried it in my way.  Staying out of the daily routine was more a wish than a reality and those daily routines in their entirety are naturally very important.  When the children were 12, I got a divorce, but I wanted to continue the relationship and so actively pursued it. |*| 6 | (R): Consciously, no.  But it is for sure. This is one of my experiences that it is one dimensional to say daughter, son.  Then you will never overcome that is a girl or that is a boy.  Psychologists will confirm that it is a complex issue and that part of the difference boy/girl is what father/mother project. That is already different and on top of it, siblings have different positions vis-*| à*| -vis each other.  Where one is strong, the other one will voluntarily back down.  It is difficult to make sense of it.  Perhaps it is possible to say at the rational level that there are ideologies, family ideologies or values, which one pushed.  But whether that turned into reality is another story.  What will become of children is not influenced by the gendered behavior of their parents; that is only one of many things.” |

On that day, the female students did not have to come to school, but had to accompany their mothers or fathers to work and spend the day there in order to observe the work.  That was something that did not exist for the boys.   But then our school also introduced ‘boys’ day’, which happened once a year.

I was 11 or 12 years old.   I was talking with my mother about what I would like to do or to become.  I had many different ideas, e.g. veterinary medicine. But my mother asked me why I would chose such complicated studies followed by such a hard job in the field.  She said that one should not imagine to just treating guinea pigs, but there will be cows and horses and such. And she added that it would be really much more sensible to become primary school teacher.  You work four hours per day and the rest you can spend at home.  You have time and if you have family, it is the perfect profession for you.  I did not quite know what to say to that because what I heard did not suit me at all.  Cause I had always been a wild child who played with the boys.  To imagine to address a group of children as their primary school teacher was an absurd thought; far from any imagined reality.  And that was the first time that I was really astonished because my mother knew me, knew who I was; knew my character and my abilities.  I was astonished that she would propose such a job to me, which really did not match my abilities.  I realized then that as a woman we tend to assume the responsibilities for the family.  We organize it so that it can function.  And then it makes sense the way one chooses ones job.  It all fits.” |*| 3 | (R): Yes.  That was the way she argued*| *| . |*| 5 | (R): I thought about it.  But it felt so uncomfortable that I came to the conclusion: No, I do not want to become a primary teacher for sure. Even if later on, moving into that direction so that I could have said that I am a good teacher.  No, there was no way I was going to become a teacher because I was so hurt by that suggestion which was so unlike me.  Moreover, to have to think about – at the age of 12 – which job I will have and about a family, which at that point I did not want.  Those were terrifying thoughts for me: to have a child at the age of 18 who I have to consider in my decisions.   And so I excluded all that and did not justify it in the family and did not have a child until late, because I did not want to subsume everything in my life, all that what I wanted to do, to having a child. |*| 7 | (R):  My mother*| *|  well..it was clear.. She is a family person and calls herself an earth mother. She had me when she was 18 and there was no question about it.

I was going to find something different.  The father was a very dominant person in the family, up to the point, that my two older sisters were also forced to work in the family business.  Unfortunately, they were not allowed to continue and finish high school, in particular the oldest one. She was more or less taken from school, (having only attained an intermediate degree), although she had all the brains, qualification and the will for it, to pass the baccalaureate and possibly to study.  I have to note here that she, at the age of 62, began university studies.  She made up for it what her father had forbidden her to do once she was at the pensionable age.  She has my greatest respect.  Unfortunately, her cancer did not allow her to come very far.” |

As I said, this has not so far been such a big issue for me*| *| Perhaps it is simply because it is easier for a man, because one is not openly confronted with it by earning less or being disadvantaged in many situations.  But now, in this relationship, I have noticed that these things become issues more often.   Sometimes only as a socio-political issue, because it is part of a general discussion and my point of view is a different one, that is that there is no issue for me because I judge things from my perspective.  On the other hand, my girlfriend knows much better and shows me where there are injustices. |*| 2 | But then this is mirrored in the relationship, so that certain activities present themselves again so that it is me who checks the washing machine.  And the girlfriend has the impression that she puts more work into the apartment. I would not necessarily link that to particular role models, but say that my girlfriend is more orderly than me and I don’t care so much and do not expect her that she does these things for me.  But these types of discussions are more and more frequent.  And so this is the first time for me, funnily enough in the relationship, that I am confronted with my role as a man.  Something I did not know before. |*| 4 | (R): Yes, of course. |*| 6 | (R):  We also fight.  Because I don’t understand it.  I look at it as me being not very orderly and less interested to do this; and I am not expecting the woman to do it for me.  But my girlfriend believes it has something to do with gender roles, perhaps because out of interest and her personal experiences, perhaps from the point of view of a woman who has always been treated differently.  I do not share her opinion.  But then on the other hand, if the garage door does not function, it is me who is expected to do it.  That I find a bit strange and then having to talk about this role model thing.  I like closing the garage door.  But I am also of the opinion that society would function well when that wouldn’t be an issue anymore.  And there I think we think alike in terms of goals.  And that everybody does what suits him or her best.  And I do not mean by it that my girlfriend is more gifted to do the dishes or clean.  But when I have to lift a washing machine I prefer to do that with a strong man or a strong woman than with somebody who is weaker.   That's only logical.  I think we should apply logic not role models. But in the relationship, all this has become more and more of an issue.  But the goal remains the same.  I have been accused of being stuck in several male role models; but conversely, I would venture to say that she, while propagating her vision of liberation, is more bound by old role models than me perhaps.  But I would never dare say  that (laughs); that would lead to confrontation, which I do not want to have.  But I have great sympathies for the women’s movement and support any type of sexual liberation and regard this gender thing as completely overvalued and out of proportion, but above all unsolved, ‘cause the question really is whether there are really only two genders or perhaps there are more? |

I was assigned to the planning unit and worked together with male colleagues.  We all had the same professional training.  I was a real newcomer, but then worked there for a total of five and a half years.  And then the following happened.  I heard, after more than five years, what a colleague of mine earned.  At that time I earned 1600 Deutsche Mark, and I always assumed that my colleagues earn the same what I earn, perhaps a bit more if they had worked more years than me.  Yes, and then at some point one of my colleagues told me that he earned 3500 Deutsche Mark.  I nearly fainted and said to him to repeat what he had just said.  And he said: ‘Yes, I am earning 3500 DM and what do you earn?’  And then I said:’ do you know what I earn? I earn 1600.’ ‘That is impossible!’ ‘Yes’, I said, ‘that’s what I earn.’ I was so devastated that I immediately said to myself to go to my boss and ask for more money or I quit. Then I asked to see my boss.  He asked me what it was I wanted.  I told him that I wanted a higher salary.  He to me:’ why would you want more money?’ Well, I told him, that I wanted a higher salary because I had found out that, that salaries here differed, that my colleagues were earning more money than me.  He answered: ‘that is correct, Ms G, but think about it, you have the highest salary of all women working in this company.’  I replied ‘what do you mean, the highest salary?  I am not interested in what other women earn here whether they are assistants to the CEO, or whether they treat incoming offers, whatever.  I want to be compared to my colleagues. That simple.’  He just replied, that no, that is impossible and I should realize, that it is after all the man – he said this verbatim – ‘it is the man who is the breadwinner of the family.’  Then he asked me to leave his office.  I drew my conclusions quite quickly and decided to leave the company.  And that was what I did. |*| 3 | (R): Yes, at the time, I wanted to.  I was convinced I had the best chances.  And of course I talked to my family, my mother, who also said that such a treatment was illegal.

Perhaps it would have been the right thing to do. |*| 5 | (R): Yes, I looked for a new job and there I also received equal pay. |

That happened quite a lot when I was younger, was that there were these stupid sexualized remarks, but also other types of remarks. but I must say.. I come from the countryside where that does not happen that often. But when I moved to B. and then to K. such things started to happen quite frequently.  It happened so frequently that in the beginning, I held up my head high and paid full attention, but stopped all that later on.. That is because one walks along, says hello, but then the answer is verbal abuse or “hi sweetie,” or something along those lines.  When such things happened, I always thought, that I have to react faster, because every time I was dumbfounded and couldn’t react.  People touch you indecently in the metro filled with people and then the person jumps off and there is nothing one can do, or there is a stupid remark and nothing comes to mind to counter it.  Then I thought that I just have to think of something that was at a time when these things happened quite frequently.  I remember this one incident when I was riding a motorbike and a car stopped tight next to me.  The side window came down and I thought that it will come again and I started to scream ‘you wanker”..I was furious ‘cause I thought here it comes again, another lewd remark.  But then I looked at him because I had avoided eye contact at first.. And then he just simply asked where he could find the cinema.  And that was really embarrassing for me.  I thought that this shouldn’t be like that; that I had become like that; that I am this although I am not like that.  So I told this story to a girlfriend of mine when we went out for a drink and once again as we were about to mount my bike, there was this drunk..while I was telling the story..and this drunk asked whether he could join us on the bike.  And I thought, that ok, I am going to be friendly this time, he is only drunk.  So I tell him that it is better to take a taxi.  Then we mounted the bike and were just about to head off, he said: ‘You only want to be fucked, you cunts.’  And then I thought again that I couldn’t be prepared for something like that and that I do not want to be prepared for something like that.  I think at this point I am more quick-witted on the one hand, but on the other hand, there is a part of me, which has given up, since I don’t know.. I would like to be friendly to people and do not always want to anticipate something stupid coming my way.   And when something comes, one can swallow some of it; I just have to risk it, and if I get a lewd remark – in the best and in the worst case, I remain friendly.” |

Despite the fact that my parents were totally convinced, somehow I never noticed any injustices or disadvantages in daily life.  And then, something happened, I had a revealing experience; nowadays I think often about it because it did change my perspective a bit.  When I was interviewed in the context of the university entrance exam, in 2006, I was just taking the exams for my baccalaureate, they gave me text, well I had to present the text, which dealt with the differences in pay for women and men. It also dealt with access to care facilities for children in certain companies, and that many companies, given the lack of qualified personnel, create such facilities in order to attract more women.  Well, I had to present that text and then I had questions, which I had to answer.  And then one woman of the selection committee asked me:’ Yes, Ms H, why do you think that women earn less than men?’  Well, I didn’t think at all.  I just thought I have to find an answer quickly without ever having thought about it.  And then I just said:’ Well, they do not work as hard as men do.’ And the person on the committee looked at me mouth agape and said:  ‘how could you ever say a thing like that!’ But afterwards I thought about all that and determined that my statement had indeed lacked all foundation.” |

As the saying goes: ‘one has to marry’.  Then came the second child, the son.  If the first child is a girl and the second child a son, it is only natural to try to form the son according to what one thinks the son should become as a man.  Unfortunately, one discovers that there are limits and that the son will go his own way.  In addition, the son was born in Japan where the son, not as much anymore as before, but still is treated like a crown prince.  But I didn’t want that since that was exactly what my father had expected from me; I wanted to be different from my father and that was not easy and also because of the job.  And so one is prevented to do so; one does not pay enough attention unfortunately.  I know I paid more attention to my second daughter as happens so often.  The pet of the family was more spoiled than the son, perhaps also because my job was very demanding.  What left an indelible impression was an event that happened when the son was in early puberty, around 10 and I was alone with the three children because the mother was not home.  She had left the house and I was attending a conference in China when I got this phone call that I should get a nanny or babysitter.  And because the two girls could play with each other, I tried to get a student who could also stay in the house.  And that was how I got a babysitter mainly for him when I was away for a long weekend or to a weeklong conference in China.  And then my son called me, ‘Daddy, what does he want from me? I want to sleep alone in my bed,’ and that was very shocking for me.  I would not have expected this; I knew the boy; that was my mistake; I did not realize my responsibilities early enough.  I didn’t know the boy well enough and left him alone at home with my children.  And apparently, I will not say that he is a pedophile, but somehow he must have had the urge to lie in bed with my son or whatever, and that shocked me very much.  I then tried to call a friend of mine who I trusted, an old school colleague, who also lived in B.  I asked him to go over there and if possible or necessary, take my son with you and chase him away.  I was very emotional, and my friend did was I had told him.  But I had the impression that my son was very insecure particularly because I had been alone with him over the past couple of months.  And he had been looking somehow for contact, and such contact was given to him, only negatively and that was very shocking for me.  I must say, as a father, being alone with one’s son is relatively difficult to be together in a positive way at the emotional level.  We had quite some fights, then. And it is obvious that as a father one is in a superior position and then it becomes difficult the son his space.  And it is difficult for the son to live out his emotions.  I believe that for the son, the mother remains the stronger emotional centre, the magnet, whilst with my daughters; it was much easier for the father being closer, even physically.  That must have been a troubling experience for my son and I believe it is still with him.  It is difficult to judge in the end, he is independent now and is finding his own way.  But this experience probably also made its marks on me.  Up to then I was convinced that same sex relations are part of nature and that one must accept that.

It has to be sturdy and cool, and he has to*| *|  He wants his pants to hang low because the girls find this cool. His hair has to look like that of Justin Bieber, because the girls like that. And (name daughter) is then such a real girl. What she likes to do? She does gym, and she wants to dance and sing all the time and she also goes to drawing lessons. And she always wants to look as feminine as possible. If you ask (name son) what he wants to become later, then he wants to be a manager, and he wants to succeed in life. And when you ask the same question to (daughter),*| *|  Oh, then she wants to be a hairdresser or cosmetician, or danser or something. I find that quite typical, so masculine – feminine. But what my influence is in this? Nothing in fact. Absolutely nothing. Because I do not recognise anything of myself in (daughter). When I had given birth to her, that was also “Gosh! Me, a girl?! How do I have to do that? And skirts and ribbons*| *|  pfff.” It was absolutely not so that I pushed her in a girls’ pattern. Yes, our (son) I sometimes try to steer him, so that*| *|  That women are indeed equivalent or even superior to men.

And that appeared a pretty impossible combination, to both work as an independent and to bring up children.

I think it’s nearly fifty-fifty now, the number of women that starts at the basic level.

So*| *| *|  I would not fit that picture. And then they appointed two male team leaders, and then I disappeared from the scene for a year due to illness, and in that year they fired one of those male colleagues.

I think that women are a bit more human or more social. Not that men are inhuman, but*| *|  Yes, those that I have in mind now, those are so very, very ambitious*| *|  about everything.

But it starts now. But it’s still the women, and you can find it here too (she refers to a staff magazine of the police she had with her), who more frequently ask for office service, or a nine-to-five job at the office.

That means my parents were 39 when I was born. My mother was almost 40 when I was born. That meant that I always had the oldest parents of the class. At a given moment, just to situate the story, my parents came to collect my report during secondary (education) and one of my classmates asked why my grandmother had come along! So, I always found that funny because I had no problems with it, because, in terms of mentality they were far more advanced than many of those young parents. If we, when we were sixteen, threw a class party and there had to be someone responsible, none of those young parents could be there. Because there was always to be an adult, you know: we were only sixteen and in that room there had be to an adult ... Who was always there? At all those parties of my brothers and sisters, that was my father. And that was also smart because in the meantime he had also a bit of control!

His father wanted him to take over the company, unless he wanted to enter the seminary, that he wanted to become a priest. So he had the choice. The choice was very simple: either work at home in the garden [the family company grows fruit and vegetables], work as fruit grower and continue the company, or learn. But then: priest. There was nothing to do about it. And so he chose – because of course he did not want to become a priest and he knew my mother already at that time – he chose to enter into the business. He has never liked that. He studied Latin-Greek until the last year and then had to stop; and these frustrations are still alive. And this has had an enormous influence on us; that certainly had an enormous influence on our study choices and on our choices in life. Because my father absolutely wanted that we continued studying, in whatever field we wanted, and that we would do something that we wanted to do. He would never have forced us to do anything, in terms of study choice, because he himself found it terrible he never had that choice. So we have all had the opportunity and the possibilities and the choices to do so.  |*| 3 | (*| *| ) |*| 4 | R: My mother was very silent and very resigned. She just endured everything.

They never questioned whether they would not better build their own house and own little family. No, they considered there was no alternative because my father had no brothers or sisters and he was the only one to take care of his father. And my mother has always done it very patiently.  |*| 5 | (*| *| ) |*| 6 | R: The most important thing that I learnt from that is how my parents always took stance for us. They always succeeded to maintain the peace. Towards my grandfather soothing: yes, yes, we will solve that and we will address that and we will and so on*| *|  And when the door closed, so to say, they came to us and said: “look, vava said this or that, but we’ll agree this and you can do this or that, but we won’t talk about it”. Or: “you tell vava that*| *| ”. Yes, white lies, that was warp and woof. Tell him we go to the youth movement, for example, and then we went swimming. Because going swimming, that was also not done for girls. That was also such a thing. So then we made agreements with my parents that we would not tell him. It happened like this. But that means that all five of us, we all five very much feel this way, we feel tremendously supported by our parents. They always stood by us when it came to these things. Because he really would have done things completely differently. That really was a turn of 180*| °*| , my father compared to my grandfather. And they did not get along, as you can imagine. |*| 7 | (*| *| ) |*| 8 | R: Although there have been serious fights between my father and my grandfather. We know that, because my father told us.

There they could prosper. (*| *| ) When it came to me, (*| *| ), I was in fact the only one left. And my father considered it absolutely pointless to drive to (name place) only for me. So I had to go to boarding school, but in (other place name). |*| 12 | (*| *| ) |*| 13 | R: So then it came to me, but not in (name place), but rather in (2nd place name). But (2nd place name) is only 6 kilometers from where I lived. All my class mates from the primary school went by bike in the morning. That was a group of ten, maybe fifteen, a whole bunch driving to (2nd place name). And I had to stay there in the evening. And they had not thought about this. And the homesickness made me ill. And after half a year, I think, at Christmas*| *|  no, at Easter, the first school year at Easter, I already could join the others with the bike. |*| 14 | (*| *| ) |*| 15 | R: There was nobody of the first year students staying there, and that has been a mistake of my father. This was not a good solution. (*| *| ) And so it happened that after half a year I became an external. That is how it happened. But my father still stays: you have had many more opportunities. Of course, I followed ten years later. My grandfather was already demented, when I was at secondary school. We then did not suffer from it so much anymore, because he was already demented by then. He died when I was fifteen, and he had been severely demented the last 7, 8 years.  |*| *| ? |*| 17 | R: More chances than had they simply stayed at home.

I mean, not that I had no ambition, but for me, a family, that was definitely part of it. So I said from the start: good, as soon as we have children and someone needs to work fewer hours because of that, or there is a reason, then I will do that with pleasure because for me, my lifework are my children and all that I can do next to that is very nice and pleasant but if I choose for children*| *|  We consciously choose for children, but children do not choose for parents with this type of job. So that was my priority. As soon as we say ‘children’, I was to take my responsibility. Of course that implied that nearly automatically that role pattern arose. Because I continued, I was home on Wednesday afternoon, and I picked the up in the evening. And that’s where it started, that I did not want this, in fact.  |*| 3 | (*| *| ) |*| 4 | R: (Name husband), he has never ironed, filling the washing machine at best, doing the dishes and so, the dishwasher and so, that he does, but otherwise*| *|  There certainly was no balanced division, no. And, result is: now, with my children, because I have always said that, that in fact I do not want it like this, I often talked with them about this. And when my son was fourteen, fifteen, and I was ironing a shirt, then I called him with me: come, I am going to show you how to iron a shirt. And my daughter found that weirder than him, that I said that. He found, yes, my brother is divorced, he said: ‘uncle (name), he also has to iron his shirts himself, hasn’t he? Yes, it’s good that I learn this, yes, this is okay.’ Result: we’re ten years later now, let’s say, they are now twenty seven and twenty eight. Our (name son) is, or becomes, definitely a ‘new man’, and (name daughter) wants a new man. It’s as simple as that for sure. They find it perfectly normal that you both work, that the tasks at home and outside home are divided. And they find it not normal the way I have been functioning. So (name son) for sure becomes a new man, and (name daughter) is looking for a new man, she wants a new man. In any case.  |*| 5 | (*| *| ) |*| 7 | R: That’s how it started in fact. And that has been my biggest mistake. My mother did not work, but I have always worked, but... Yes, my mother did not work, my aunts were no working women, so I only saw women doing the household. So I was also very young, my two sisters also, we all three were only twenty one when we married. At the time that was not weird either, but we considered it normal that we did what our mothers did. While we did go out working full-time, all three of us, and she did not. Not my mother. So that has never been an issue. Also, my husband has never questioned that either, like ‘is that now right?’ And now I think: yes, yes, that’s easy, isn’t it? Keep silent, don’t say anything, that’s the easiest, then you don’t ever have to do anything*| *|   |*| 9 | R: No, in fact not. Yes, no, no, I have not tried that because*| *|  In fact, he has never had a 'nine to five' job. If you*| *| , that’s how I feel about it, I should not complain because I have always known that he is very ambitious and that he’s not a nine-to-fiver. And never will be either. (*| *| ) There are always things that I can ask him. Certainly now, yes, in the past also, always. For example, he brought something to the bank, to the post office, to the health insurance office, to all those places. That he did because his office*| *|  Yes, he could do all of that on his way; as an independent you can do all that, and that he did indeed. (*| *| ) That he does, that he did, and that he still does. That’s no problem whatsoever. But the shopping for the daily vegetables and meat, the day-to-day worries, he doesn’t. But with growing older, I much more resign myself to that. The more I read about this and so, that there are a number of things that seem to be genetic, or something like that. I really start to believe that men do not see that the bin is full. That men really do not see this, or cannot remember that Tuesday is waste container day.  |

Not at all. And I received a letter back that regrettably it was not possible. As a woman you couldn’t do anything, that was not allowed and so on. And then I decided that I wanted to have nothing at all to do with the Church anymore. (*| *| ) That was one of the things that I have never been able to understand: why women cannot have a higher position, not much more than nun, and housekeeper of the parish priest, and cleaning the church and lighting the candles, but not much further than that. Popes, bishops, cardinals, whatever, even priest was not possible, and that I could not grasp. Even if I had no vocation, I found it unfair. |*| 3 | (*| *| ) |*| 4 | R: When our children where little, I really left them the choice: do you want to do your holy communion, your first communion, holy communion?

And she continued to have her job with lots of responsibility and a good salary. And they love each other so they manage it. But it is now three years that he is at home with their daughter and I can see the mental damage he suffers from, it is like his personality is diminishing, his self-confidence, orientation, social capacities. He has become that sort of demanding wife that wants to have expensive things for partner’s money and never knows when to stop. This is strange, the wife syndrome that they sort of lost the idea of a value of money because they are out of the labor market for so long. And they buy their status through material things as if they have a luxury model of a handbag or so they would feel better, they use husband’s money to increase their status, I even do not know how to call it. But maybe it is just my impression, maybe it makes them happy, then it is OK even if it is for husband’s money. But if it is about buying some prestige, then I see it as some sickness, some internal lack of satisfaction and natural self-confidence that arises from the fact that a person is capable to reach something. Unfortunately, in Slovakia women who stay at home are not valued at all. They do not receive any appraisal, with some exceptions, in order to live a satisfactory life. Society always tells her that it is OK, but she has not done that and that.  |*| 3 | R: Yes. In addition, husbands are not used to do what is necessary to do for women at home. I mean to take them out, to meet people. Families do not naturally live a community life so a wife can have enough social contacts. Let's admit it, any animal gets crazy while being alone and the same thing happens to a woman who is at home with children for a long time. Children have needs and demand things and she automatically becomes isolated by those needs and if her surrounding does not understand it and does not create social stimuli and opportunities for some self-realization she will loose her social capacities. And she becomes aggressive and so.  |*| 4 | (*| *| ) |*| 5 | R: On one hand I perceive it as very progressive when I saw that it can work (a man on a parental leave), I perceive it as great that everyone is doing what responds to his or her mental capacities at that moment and if a wife has a good job, good career and can earn enough money to support family, a husband has no problem to stay at home and it is OK.  |*| 6 | (*| *| ) |*| 7 | R: (*| *| ) But now I see the results. And it is not the only case. Another friend was with his wife abroad where she had a job and he took care of their daughter. It did not work out very well I must say. He told me that she had stopped to take him seriously after a while. That she had stopped to perceive it as a family decision, a sacrifice but she had thought he had not been capable of anything else. When they came back he started to build his career very intensively, aggressively I would say, and it really affected their relationship. She was not able to admit that she was not the dominant one, to accept the change of dynamics he introduced and she felt threatened. It is really interesting how different are the models  in relationships.   |

I got divorced after 8 years of marriage and the whole family intensively participated. It was a sort of catharsis.

Before I had that typical married life according to rules.  |*| 2 | (*| *| ) |*| 3 | R: (*| *| ) I invested a lot in the relationship. I tried to be a good wife, I did house work, laundry, ironing, cooking, it took a lot of my time. But you think that your partner will give it back, that today you recruit the fire and tomorrow he will do it. But it requires a really adult attitude. I have a feeling that in this sense men have learnt from education, of course there are exceptions, to receive but they are not aware of equality between a man and a woman in responsibilities and in pleasures, in family and at work. This is what I really appreciate in Scandinavia. Here in Slovakia we are only learning how to do it. This is how I see Slovak men. And this is probably the reason why I have never got married again, so far. I always felt the threat in a relationship that I need to balance the partnership and my own activities, my lifestyle, freedom of expression, my independence that I really need and it is my basic right.  |*| 4 | (*| *| ) |*| 5 | R: (*| *| )  That you cannot protect it, that you will be again in that unequal position. That you will break away from your need for freedom because the relationship becomes a priority or the balance in family.  |*| 6 | (*| *| ) |*| 7 | R: (*| *| ) Based on my divorce I realized that traditional marriage was not according to my mental needs and it was really difficult to get out of marriage. It was an incredible fight, internal one, with my family, with all those stereotypes. It was difficult to explain it; I was the first one in my family. Nowadays I completely understand people who suffer in marriage, I have compassion with them. It does not matter whether they are men or women, you can see it that a person made some decision and now it is difficult to explain why she needs to get out of it.  |*| 8 | (*| *| ) |*| 9 | R: (*| *| ) You just get out and you loose life instructions that you used to have because of the tradition. And you start from scratch. You are on a Siberian plane and there is nothing around. And you defend your right to live without traditions, even if you threaten the right of your clan to continue because you have no children and are divorced. Everyone expects that you will come back soon, continue, get married again*| *|  They give you some time, some three, four, five years and if you do not they are worried, they do not understand what is going on, where is a problem.  |*| 10 | (*| *| ) |*| 11 | R: (*| *| ) I see around lots of divorced women who just started to flourish, they realize their dreams. Of course they are emotionally frustrated or they sleep alone that is not pleasant all the time and maybe they want to have someone on their side, but the feeling that they need to catch up with something or experience something different; it keeps them in a distance. Of course they have lovers and so, but I can see how they wake up their individuality, how they figure out what they really want, they are just different.  |

He used as an example a research on non-conformist behavior among top managers, whether there are people at these positions who are hippie like; who look different than expected standards of the dress code and so. And he used an example of long hair. And I looked at him – since when does long hair mean non-conformity? If we talk about top managers there should be women there as well, they have a right to be top managers.  |*| 3 | R: And he said, well, ups. The example continued – if we randomly choose from employers and put them into top management positions whether the situation would be different. And again I corrected him because again he used an example of earrings. Women normally wear earrings!  |*| 4 | (*| *| ) |*| 5 | R: (*| *| ) I was surprised that a person with international experience can have this attitude. But this is Slovak background he came from.  |*| 6 | (*| *| ) |*| 7 | R: (*| *| ) I am upset that people still think on these levels, that they do not want to move further. They are not aware of the fact that some women do not want it and are placed only in domestic sphere simply because everyone expects them to do so, that this is the society pressure. So women do not have ideas about being single, without a partner, even without children. I do not know, as if a woman still does not have a choice. I am not saying that now all women need to be single and without children. I am just saying that this is an area of their lives in which they should have a choice. And not these societal attitudes that she will finish university, get a job, find a man, the best at the time of university studies and go for a maternity leave for three years. And then it would be good to have another child that means another three years and the personal and social capital of that woman will completely disappear. But this is the idea. And women are not aware of it, they do not think about it; that they maybe want something different deep inside.  |*| 9 | R: They are educated in that way since their childhood. They are not aware of other possibilities.  |*| 11 | R: Sure. Yes, yes. And when I tell them that I have different ideas about life, that I do not want to, I do not know, anything can happened, but I do not want to get married and have children. It is not in my plans. I would like to do something that brings real satisfaction. It does not mean that I am a cruel person. I do not know*| *|  I am communicative, I like to meet people, so*| *|  fall into someone else’s line, because the relationship is sometimes about falling into someone else’s line. That is not my style. And men do expect a wife to be at home, at least Slovak men.  |*| 12 |  (*| *| ) |*| 13 | R: (*| *| ) For example, I walk the streets or so, I meet people, I am a communicative person, so I start conversations. But if it is with men I am trying to seduce them. Women often tell me that I am trying to seduce every man. But this is not what I do. I communicate with men in the same way I do with women and it does not mean that I am seducing anyone. They never say that I seduce women! If I communicate with women, it is normal. If I communicate with men, I seduce them. It really irritates me, I do not like it, it is so... People think really narrowly and do not move further.   |*| 14 | (*| *| ) |*| 15 | R: (*| *| ) I often encounter that if a woman is single, without a partner, for example my grandparents, I am 23 and they have never met my boyfriend so my grandmother asked me whether I am of a different sexual orientation*| *|  that is really funny. They push me to introduce them to some boy because it is not normal if a woman in my age has no man. So once she asked me directly whether everything was OK and whether I were a lesbian.  |

There were 18 candidates out of which three were women. The other two had only secondary education, not that it is discriminatory or bad. However, I was the only woman with university education and I was the youngest one.  |*| 3 | R: Yes, youngest of all. This is when I felt that there is a glass ceiling in Slovakia. I probably had the best qualification because I even have a degree in public affairs. But there were only men elected to the self-government and one woman. I really believe that it was the glass ceiling because these other people had lower education than me that is not necessarily bad or inadequate but the way I understand it is that there is an assumption that a young woman cannot understand a thing. This is the rural attitude of Slovakia. When I came to the self-government with some suggestions how to do things differently, how to be more proactive and publicize information I had a feeling that they thought that I did not understand anything and why I cared and that I was too young to be taken seriously. I still have that feeling.  |*| 4 | (*| *| ) |*| 6 | R: Yes, there has never been a woman in a position. According to my knowledge there is only that one lady who is serving her second term. But before, I do not know about any other woman who is interested in this sort of things. In fact, people expect that it should be a man in the position, with secondary or even better university education. This is the idea of that person.  |*| 8 | R: I talked to them. But I did not have leaflets because it occurred to me that it was, I do not know, it was strange to praise myself. If it was for someone else, I would have pointed out that it was a good person so people could notice; I would probably be more active. Surely, more active. But as it was about me, I do not know, I did not want to create an impression that I pushed myself.  |*| 10 | R: This is the thing, the reactions were positive. I was surprised how people, even older people, told me that it was great that I tried. One lady who had moved to our neighborhood told me that in her previous place there were no young people willing to become members of self-government. So I was quite positive about a possibility to be elected, that it was not that difficult. And then I got surprised.  |*| 11 |  (*| *| ) |*| 12 | R: Formally, I was able to run for the position. Informally, I was a young woman. If I were a young man the society would have taken it differently as if he would represent some hope of civic participation. But if it is a woman*| *|  As if I would necessarily fail.   |

We used to have workshop classes together, boys and girls.  |*| 3 | R: Or maybe it was divided into groups. That one group went to the workshop, to do something manually with a gripper or so (laugh) I do not remember precisely. And the second group went to the garden to work on it. I liked that.  |*| 5 | R: (*| *| ) And then, I think it was in 8th or 9th grade, girls started to have cooking lessons and boys continued with manual workshops. And girls had also child care lessons; boys did not have those. A teacher came with a doll and showed us how to change diapers.  |*| 7 | R: Yes, there was a small bath tub, everything.  |*| 9 | R: Fourteen. It was completely senseless. Even at that time we laughed about it. It was very artificial. Plus, what will you remember from childcare out of what you have learnt when being fourteen? Nothing. When I had my child I did not use any knowledge gained during those lessons at the age of fourteen.  |*| 11 | R: Yes, there was something, some book or brochure. But I really do not remember it, really. It was weird. Even at that time it was weird to us. And there was another thing that we perceived as unfair. We had those cooking classes and we cooked something and then we were forced to bring it to boys so they could eat it.  |*| 13 | R: Not at all. That is why we considered it as, you know they did not do anything for us and we were supposed to give them something. It was not our idea; a teacher said that we needed to give meals to boys.  |*| 14 | (*| *| ) |*| 16 | R: In a way, yes. But it is so vague, you get it from different channels, in bits and pieces, it is not a direct communication. But now, as you are asking, I remembered a situation from a school trip. We were in 5th grade or so. And our teacher did not have a better idea than to arrange a wedding, as a sort of a carnival. It seemed pretty crazy, without any sense at that time. She dressed us up as a wedding*| *|  I was the bride. I do not know why, I never was a princess sort of girl. Maybe in a kindergarten during the carnival, golden hair, you know. Though I have never had a golden hair. (laugh) But not later, at grammar school. So I was a bride. I wore a folk costume. I have no idea where she got it, maybe she prepared it in advance. So she dressed us up, gave me a groom. I looked at him what it was! I did not like him, I would have never chosen him. (laugh) So we were dancing and singing as if we were at the wedding. Pretty absurd!  |

At that time I worked in academia and I spoke English so they assigned me to accompany her because I was able to communicate with her. And she carried out a gender-oriented research. That’s how I found about it. And I got interested in it. She already knew women from Aspekt [feminist publishing house] and she gave me their contact. That there was a group that I might have found interesting. So I called.  |*| 4 | (*| *| ) |*| 5 | R: (*| *| ) You know, I believe that every reflexive and sensitive woman, or maybe not just a woman, a person sooner or later will find out about feminism. If you think about society, how it functions, relationships, how it is organized and all the hierarchies.  |*| 6 | (*| *| ) |*| 7 | R: (*| *| ) I had a negative reaction in academia. It was in 94-95. A male colleague asked me to prepare an overview of feminism, or of feminism in our area of research. We used to have internal seminars and he was interested in many new issues and modern theories. And I will never forget how I came there, sat down with my notes and started to talk. I said about three phrases when another male colleague stood up and said that it was bullshit. So sorry*| *|  (laugh) |*| 9 | R: Not really, there were other people who were at least interested in it. They had objections and a discussion was quite lively. But the others at least listened to me. That one, he knew nothing about it but was sure that it was bullshit. I even do not remember how I reacted. I guess that someone else told him that he was not obliged to sit there.  |*| 10 | (*| *| ) |*| 12 | R: Later it was OK. |*| 14 | R: Yes, second half of nineties. Aspekt started in 93, so you can see because there was nothing before, it started to crystallize and after some 5 years people started to be aware of it. |*| 16 | R: Sure, yes. There was this magazine [feminist magazine] and those who wanted to have a general orientation on trends should have paid attention. Not exactly to march with posters! (laugh) |*| 18 | R: It was so, exotic. I think that the perception of feminists was similar to nowadays. |*| 20 | R: I think so. But maybe I am more reluctant now, you know. (laugh)  |*| 21 | (*| *| ) |*| 22 | R: (*| *| ) So yes, it was a strange period, everything was so, how to call it, new lines appeared leading to various directions.

It is as if you churn up a puddle and gradually it starts to calm down.  |*| 24 | R: Yes, yes. It was a very exciting period for me. Something completely different. I do remember how I read those magazines. I was passionate about it. And when they let me to write something or translate something for the magazine; that was wow! |*| 26 | R: Sure, hundred percent. But later I retrospectively realized that I already had known it. I had some perceptions but I did not formulate them. So it was rather in a way: wow, this was it, I just did not know how to put it in words.  |*| 27 |   |

I said what I wanted to study, I was accepted there, so no problem. In the partnership, it was a bit different. I think that there, there was a period when I tried to persuade my ex to continue his education, because he started university but has never finished it. There was a period when I gathered information whether he could have studied and so. Because I had a feeling that it bothered him.   |*| 6 | R: As if he had a feeling of inferiority, yes.

I have never told him that he had only secondary education, I have never thought about it, never taunted him in no way that he had secondary education and not university.

He told afterwards, when I had got offended that he did not mean it but he behaved the same way again, mainly among friends, when we sat and, got forbids, that I said something and he started on.  |*| 9 | (*| *| ) |*| 11 | R: Not at all.

He was the only one who ironed. So they changed the roles. But when she left the position, the roles got back.  |*| 3 | R: It quite suffered. Those were terrible years.   |*| 5 | R: I started the secondary school, fifteen – sixteen. The family life suffered. My parents used to quarrel a lot at that time. It was critical. But partially it was due to the fact that my mother was stressed at work, she did not have a managerial education necessary for the job and she brought the stress to home. And father might have been unhappy with domestic activities that he was not good in. He ironed when I was 14 for the first time in his life! |*| 6 | (*| *| ) |*| 7 | R: (*| *| ) Later I found out that my father had had suspicions that my mother had been unfaithful; maybe because she had been in a male society or dominantly male*| *|  All mayors in the region were men.   |*| 9 | R: Not really. I remember my father telling a story*| *|  They laughed about it later when they talked about it. Otherwise I would not talk about it either*| *|  he told me that once a car stopped in front of our house and she went out without saying anything and there was a guy in a car. He felt uncomfortable about it. So that is probably another reason why family life suffered.  |*| 10 | (*| *| ) |*| 11 | R: My parents discuss things a lot. Probably they came up with some scenarios how it would be and were ready to reactions of a society. There was this thing – my mother was called Mrs Mayor (in Slovak it is used as an adjective signifying a wife of a mayor] and my father explained to everyone that it was her who was the mayor not him. So he supported her. That is why he probably accepted the role change at home.  |*| 12 | (*| *| ) |*| 13 | R: (*| *| ) They figured it out together; it was not just my mother’s decision. They decided together to try it and it did not work.    |*| 14 | (*| *| ) |*| 16 | R: I think that the strict division is due to their education. My mother has always done laundry, ironed, cooked. And father is good in activities around the house. This is probably the reason. They do not mind to break stereotypes, they are liberal, they do not judge it or stick to it strictly. The proof is that they were able to switch roles for a certain period. Up to now they can. Last year my mother was at the hospital and my father took care of the family*| *|  So I think that traditional division suits them better because they do what they are good in.  |

My parents bought them to me without any problem. Looking back, it is a bit strange. I had two Barbie dolls. I liked cars and meccano as well but dolls, they had human features and I did small performances with them. But my folks gave them to me without any problem. I know that my god mother – this is one of my early memories – that my god mother said that they should have been more careful in order not to be surprised one day.  |*| 3 | R: I think I thought it was funny; I was a kid, about five years old. It just somehow got stuck in my memory. I did not understand what she had in mind: be careful because of the dolls. But I knew that it was related to the dolls, as other boys did not have them.  |*| 4 | (*| *| )  |*| 5 | R: (*| *| ) And children thought I was different because I spent more time with girls. I never felt that it was some kind of a handicap, that boys did not accept me. It got better as we grew older. Of course, they called me names but it was a period when we all taunted each other. I taunted others as well. So I took it as that being with girls is my thing to be taunted about. So I was different. But later, after the taunting period was over there was no discrimination. I had interesting collaborations with boys. I was good at faking signatures of parents. So I signed some parental notes and later could have asked other boys to do some physical work instead of me. |*| 6 | (*| *| )  |*| 7 | R: But there was a ginger boy who was also different, not really feminine but more soft, gee. And he was harassed during the whole school period. Maybe it was due to his hair color or the fact that he was softer*| *|   |*| 8 | (*| *| ) |*| 9 | R: (*| *| ) They used to demonstrate their power and he probably had nothing to*| *|  I could have said: OK if you beat me I will never ever fake the signature of your parent. But probably he had nothing to compensate. So he was harassed throughout the school with the same intensity. In my case, I did not take it seriously because it happened only in the period when everyone was taunted. But in his case it continued. |*| 10 | (*| *| )  |*| *|  |*| 12 | R: It is to a great extent the type of a personality I am but also society is changing. Sometimes it strikes me what kind of boys can become idols in Pop idol show. Girls admire them but society has no problems as well. I cannot imagine something similar in my childhood. As I remember, Slovak celebrities were, at least to a certain period, strictly stereotypical. Women were beautiful and feminine and had certain characteristics and men were strong and muscular. Even Docolomansky (a famous actor in 70’s and 80’s), that is why no one discussed that he was gay, because it was not obvious so he could have become a celebrity.   |

There is a tendency to get used to it. For example, that if [name wife] uses to feed our daughter, it becomes soon a habit and we would never consider that it could be done differently. So [name wife] often reminds me and it is good that she reminds me that we should discuss it. That it is not OK if she is always the one who feeds [name baby]. So sometimes I feed her. |*| 2 | (*| *| ) |*| 3 | R: (*| *| ) In other activities it is not stereotypical at all. I vacuum clean; wash the dishes, floor, same as [name wife] does. I think it is equally divided. I cook; I do all those activities that might be considered as female from a conservative point of view. I do them as well. Although it is a bit different when it comes to [name baby]. It is my wife who mostly changes the diapers. I am not good in it. I do it when [name wife] needs to sleep or so but she does it more often. A man and a woman should discuss these things in order to make it right; because we are a team, it needs to whizz, the time is running. So they should have a deal about these activities, discuss it. A woman gets nervous if there is no deal. And it changes throughout the time so they should regularly discuss it. I completely agree. And I think, I want to say that this is not that common in Slovak families, the stereotypes. |*| 4 | (*| *| ) |*| 5 | R: I have a friend who declares how he takes care of kids but in fact he does it only partially. He plays with them, takes them to the playground outside but to change their cloth or to clean after them*| *|  he does not do it, he just pretends to be a good dad. |*| 6 | (*| *| ) |*| 7 | R: And it has just come to my mind. I know. Nursery is a problem, a serious problem. If you say to someone in Slovakia that you want to give your child to a nursery at the age of one year, it is something you rather do not tell anyone. It is a problem. In common Slovak or Bratislava families there is this idea that a mother should stay with a child up to its three years because otherwise they would regret it.  |*| 8 | (*| *| ) |*| 9 | R: (*| *| ) These are male ideas about childcare. Men do not deal with, I do not know whether women think differently, that it is great to be at home for three years but at the same time it is a great burden for a woman. This is a deeply rooted stereotype that a woman should stay with a child up to its three years. A child in a nursery is wrong, people disapprove, that you are not able to take care of your child, that a woman should stay at home and take care of it. But there are lots of things that are not considered. On one hand it is OK if a woman is at home. But at the same time she looses, she cannot be a full time teacher, cleaning lady, pedagogue and mother. And a child in a nursery gets socialized, has new stimuli, new... just stimuli. So I think that even for a child it is better to go to a nursery. The best model is to spend a half-day at the nursery to get used to it and a half-day with a mother. A child gets socialized and has stimuli and a mother can rest and she enjoys the time with a kid much more.  |

Why they present themselves so rationally, expressing so curtly, as if they want to behave like men. I think that the opposite is, that a meeting or a work would be*| *|  |*| 3 | R: (thinking) The first two were not alike men, it was OK. But that one in [company name], the head of marketing department, I think that she wants to act like a man. Or she thinks that impressions of her will be better if she has certain male behavior.  |*| 4 | (*| *| )  |*| 5 | R: (*| *| ) Because I think, my impression is that women act this way because they feel that if they act like women, the audience would consider it as a weakness, as something inappropriate. That is what I think. They have a tendency to act according to male stereotypes, the way of dress code, they wear a dark suite and a white shirt for a press conference. They imitate men, only a tie is missing.  |*| 6 | (*| *| ) |*| 7 | R: (*| *| ) It is sort of hiding a weakness. Weakness, no! Assumed weakness! Short hair, jacket, serious face expressions, curt sentences, these are rather male features.     |*| 9 | R: Or she thinks that it will help her to win recognition. Or it is sort of a helping tool. When she is not sure how to proceed, has no ideas, she still has the stereotypical mask and she puts it on. It helps her to feel ensured and the audience believes her. Because we are used to it. We are used to the fact that generally there are men in these positions with a certain dress code, gestures, way they pronounce phrases that often say nothing*| *|  But this is rather a reflection. |*| 11 | R: I have and*| *|  I must admit that it did not evoke confidence. This is interesting how the world is stereotypical! When a woman wants to change it, when she act like a woman in a managerial position it is perceived as weak or untrustworthy or inappropriate. That is what I think. And this is a worldwide situation that if a woman wants to succeed in political or managerial positions, she needs to act according to male stereotypes in expressions, fashion, everything. I cannot imagine that a female manager would wear some chic dress, express her femininity. It would be untrustworthy and inappropriate. So she has no other chance than act like a man. This is interesting! |

I always considered as normal that if I have a relationship or marriage that we would share responsibilities. And we did. I did not cook much; it was my wife’s task after the wedding. But finally I did not have problems with it; it was me who cooked during vacations. I acted like a woman. But it is again specific and individual. As assumed, and I believe this sort of a pattern is right, that the one who maintains some emotional atmosphere or well-being is a woman. Mutually, but mostly a woman. That is the idea of keeping the family together, domesticity. And my wife had problems with emotional expressions. She did not express emotions neither towards me nor towards kids. Sometimes I felt sorry especially for our older daughter. She had a difficult relationship with my wife or other way round; my wife had a difficult relationship with our daughter. It was irrational; it is difficult to explain. Sometimes it happens that a woman after giving a birth does not bond emotionally with a child. And that was what has happened to her. And I saw it and we often quarreled about it. And that was one of the reasons why I decided that I did not want her anymore. I pitied our older daughter. Sometimes I tried to behave emotionally towards her in order to substitute the role. But it did not work very well.  |*| 2 | (*| *| ) |*| 3 | R: (*| *| ) She did everything necessary for a child; she functioned as a mother just without expressing emotions. Such a normal thing as hugging a kid for no specific reason; she did not do that. So I tried to substitute her but it was not good, the kid did not accept it. And it was schizophrenic to act in both roles. It is again the pattern. I could not be the one keeping the order and structuring things and at the same time the emotional one. I tried but it did not work. The kid did not accept it.  |*| 4 | (*| *| ) |*| 5 | R: (*| *| ) I do believe that there are differences between a man and a woman and they are based on different functioning of a brain. Statistically, I mean. And it is proved by scientific research.  |*| 6 | (*| *| ) |*| 7 | R: (...) It is related to archaic work division – hunters and collectors. Men hunted and it formed or deformed the brain in a certain way. And there is a natural selection that only those good in their function survived. And women went to the forest to collect plants. Their activities are not goal oriented, they try anything. A hunter has a goal to kill an animal, he retraces, kills, that is it... A woman looks everywhere, tries anything, collects something, it is a completely different way of thinking and acting. |*| 8 | (*| *| ) |*| 9 | Statistically, it is important to add it because there are differences. There are women who are rational, even unemotional and contrary, there are men who cry when a woman raises a voice if I can say so. Statistically it is confirmed. And it is based on evolution. So there are differences and they can be used for good in a relationship. Statistically women are more empathetic and that is why they can create and guard the emotional atmosphere better than men.   |*| 10 | (*| *| ) |*| 11 | R: (*| *| ) I believe and I have always believed that in a partnership there are certain things that are forbidden to do, for example to vilify someone. And my mother vilified my father because she knew that he would never leave due to his stereotypes about keeping family together for whether it is worth it, to safe the relationship. So she misused it. And my father failed. That is how I understood it, that he failed*| *| . And I think it is connected to what I have said earlier, that men do act more rationally. And then there is the emotional, even irrational, of course there are exceptions, but it is often irrational. And it is a male role to keep the rational level for the sake of a partnership. If there is a conflict, to keep the discussion on a factual basis not to make it a power game. And my ideas that this is the male role in partnership were paradoxically based on the behavior of my father; that he did not do it. He was a negative role model for me, in other ways he was a positive one but in this it was a negative role model and it influenced my relationships.  |

But you see female and male roles. It is not always as expected. I had a colleague there who had a great respect among students because she did what was expected from a man. She was an old, experienced teacher and a tiny, not very strong woman, but she was pretty strict. If a student behaved badly, she was able to hit him. So she was capable of pacifying the whole class of disobedient boys by using male means. I was calm and empathetic and it took me a while to gain authority.  |*| 5 | (*| *| ) |*| 7 | R: Both, there were strictly girls’ classrooms as well. There was a breeder orientation for girls and a mechanic and tractor operator orientation for boys.  |*| 8 | (*| *| ) |*| 10 | R: There were some boys in a breeder orientation, but really a minority. And in technical ones there were only boys.  |*| 11 | (*| *| ) |*| 13 | R: Actually yes, women taught the breeding classes. But it is understandable. Because the orientation was about working on farms with cows and so, so there were mostly women. And female teachers as well. And in a mechanic or tractor operator, those where they learned how to operate agricultural machines, there were only male teachers and majority of male students. As I said, I had a classroom only of boys. Sometimes there was a girl on this orientation but rarely. It was strictly divided. But again, it is understandable, I think, it is a different type of work; it requires physical strength and other types of skills. Although, it is true that there is no reason why a woman could not operate a tractor. But girls did not study that orientation, only boys.  |*| 14 | (*| *| ) |*| 16 | R: Approximately 50:50. Because on a vocational school there were two types of teachers – those teaching general classes and those teaching issues related to specific orientations. And there were male and female teachers in orientations. They had also classes connected with economy and accounting that were taught by women. And men, they taught technical ones.  |*| 18 | R: That is what I wanted to say. It did not matter. I even think*| *|  Let me remember*| *|  Mostly women, yes. We were only two men for general classes. I taught physics and civic education and there was a physical education teacher. The rest were women. So we were two men for general and then technical teachers.  |*| 19 | (*| *| ) |*| 21 | R: Of course. The management, as you call it, it was completely male, so they had male attitudes. For example, how a manager responsible for general education behaved towards women*| *|  How he behaved towards my female colleagues, he has never dared to try it on me. He used various coercion techniques, typically male, he often raised his voice towards women. But it was a generational issue as well. My colleagues, usually they were young women after school. |*| 23 | R: Yes, but he behaved differently because I was a man.  |*| 24 | (*| *| ) |*| 25 | R: Those young women, they respected him only because he was a man. It is partially as if a victim is partially responsible for what has happened.  |

There were boys’ groups and girls’ groups.    |*| 15 | R: Maybe not differently but definitely not with us. Girls were with girls. It was so at the time I was young, maybe nowadays it is different. In that before teens and teenage age it was differentiated to boys’ and girls’ groups. At least in my surrounding.  |*| 16 | (*| *| ) |*| 17 | R: (*| *| ) For example, in all the classes I attended, the classroom leader was a boy. As if boys dominated more.   |*| 19 | R: Yes, elected one. |*| 21 | R: It was not by a candidature like today. No one has ever applied for it. A teacher asked us to elect someone; there were some nominations*| *| I do not remember whether there has ever been  a girl nominated. I do not remember the nominations, but classroom leaders were always boys. |*| 23 | R: Yes, secondary.  |*| 25 | R: Yes, it was expected. I think that it was elected.

I believe that it is a question of mutual agreement. In our family, when kids were small, I must say that my wife took care of them more, I was not that present. I started to teach at that time. It was a very exciting period. I do not do domestic work. I never did. So yes, in the domestic tasks I am more egoistic than my wife, I admit. I usually sit in front of the computer and work on my things and I do not care about the household. A woman cannot afford it.  |*| 2 | (*| *| ) |*| 3 | R: Afterwards I got married. We took all the decisions together so it is not gender*| *|  only the domestic work, I do not participate much so it is on my wife’s shoulders.  |*| 5 | R: When kids were small I went out with them, for walks and so, but preparing food and so, it was done by my wife.  |*| 7 | R: Yes, playing mostly and those useful things such as laundry and so*| *|  At that time I always studied something, I had a lot to do outside of the household.  |*| 8 | (*| *| ) |*| 10 | R: Yes, permanently. My whole life. (laugh) I was a chemist doing research so it took a lot of my time and then I started to teach at the university. So I had a lot of work. |*| 12 | R: I worked a lot at home. So if it was possible, I skipped domestic work. If it was not, I participated.   |*| 13 | (*| *| ) |*| 14 | R: It was because I studied while working. My wife had already a degree at that time. I still studied, so I needed to prepare for classes. And then I changed the orientation from a chemist to a philosopher, so there was much to study to catch up. This was an important point. When I decided to change a career we discussed it together, I asked her for an opinion and she agreed. Later it seemed that it got to her nerves a bit because I really spent a lot of time studying, all my free time so I did not spend it with the family. But it has nothing to do with the fact that I am a man. I believe. |*| 16 | R: I cannot imagine that. (laugh) It was really a sort of sacrifice from her side. First few years I was really overloaded by it.  |*| 18 | R: It has been always my hobby, I just did not do it professionally. It was my only hobby, I do not garden or so. And when there was an opportunity to do it professionally*| *|  |*| 22 | R: Definitely not. That was such a period of history. But it had that negative consequence that the family suffered. I did not spend much time with children. The first years were really difficult.   |

Parents looked at me differently than on my brother. I have an older brother and I can compare. For instance, even now, me being 23 years old, my father worries more about me. I don’t know, If I go to foreign country to travel, he worries that something would happen to me, I don’t know what. It is not that he doesn’t care about my brother, but he just doesn’t worry in such way. This is something, the pressure from parents is different, because I am a girl. They are more afraid for me. And than I think that my grandparents praise my brother quite openly. When coming to his education and everything. Maybe because he is a man. For instance, they never oppose him about anything he does. (name brother) always does everything right. For me it is somehow questionable, while I am a girl. For instance, when I talked to my grandfather the other day, he was very surprised that I am considering to go to postgraduate studies. Why go, shouldn’t I find a job, (name brother) will be the one with PhD in the family. Something like that. But this are maybe really old fashioned variants. (*| *| ) |*| 3 | (*| *| ) |*| 5 | R: Yes, I don’t know. |*| 7 | R: Maybe that I am not able to take care of myself, in a sense that I am helpless. Physically, so somebody could do something to me. To, I don’t know, always have somebody with me. If I go travelling alone, which I already did, they are awfully worried. Not so much about my brother, because he is a boy, he will manage all right. For me it is always “Not to do this, not to do that, be careful.” And I must call home very often. Which I don’t mind, but I can see the difference. Well, I don’t know. (*| *| ) |*| 8 | (*| *| ) |*| 10 | R: I was also very surprised the other day, because he asked me what I will do after I finish university. Because I am very close. And he said: “Do you also consider to study further, like (name brother)?” And I said, that I don’t know yet. “Maybe it is better that you get a job.” In a sense, that maybe I am not capable enough. I don’t know. Because actually you can still feel this among them, in a relation grandpa – grandma, because grandma cooks and grandpa can’t even make his own tea. Well, maybe he can, I am not sure. But the relationship is divided precisely. While with my parents it is not like that, they do everything, one this, one that, everybody everything. The roles are not divided, woman – man. That somebody would cook more or clean more. Everything is mixed.  |*| 11 | (*| *| ) |*| 13 | R: Yes, this. They worry about everything. Also, when I started to party in high school, for example, we both have the same curfew, there were no limitations. But there was still a difference. If my brother spent the night somewhere, at his friend’s, he just did, no worries. But I always had to call and explain where and why, so they wouldn’t worry. Not to control me, but because they really worry about me more.  |*| 15 | R: He did.  |*| 17 | R: He did, but I think even if he didn’t it wouldn’t be a problem. And he often didn’t, I think. He could party. I think he was freer. Because he is a man and he can defend himself more. I don’t know, I think that they worry more about a woman, because she can get attacked, raped, somebody can do something to her. It is understandable. I already behave towards my boyfriend in a motherly manner, he must call me when he goes out, so I don’t worry or anything. So I wouldn’t say it was too strict, but there were worries. That a woman is more weak, helpless, I don’t know.  |*| 18 | (...) |*| 19 | R: (...) In our early years mother took care of us more. Father worked more, I think, and the parents also had some problems. And often there were two sides in our family. Father against my brother, me, and my mother. Well, not against. But if there were some quarrels, there were two sides. But this was not because gender. My brother was also more on mother’s side and my side, if there were conflicts. And he is also a bit atypical, while he is not this kind of a guy that a father would teach repairing a car or a bike. My brother doesn’t know how to do these things. He has always been more of a humanist person, he is interested in books and because of that I think he did not evolve close relationship with my father. They never did things together, because my brother just wasn’t interested. And then my father didn’t bugged. |*| 21 | R: No, he’s not. |*| 23 | R: My father is a typical man. I think, yes, I could say so. He actually does these things. If there is something wrong with the car, my father would do that. He repairs things. Plus it is also the fact that he earns more than my mother. And because of that you could sometimes get a feeling, that he thinks of himself as more important. Well, ok, these are my feelings, but maybe it was like that. Because he earned more money he and then he thinks that he does more for the family. Or, that a family depends on him more than on my mother. But yes, he is very typical man, my father.  |*| 25 | R: No. That is exactly the point, my mother is not a typical woman. She is more a human than a woman, in a sense, that she is not this typical housewife or that she would go and drink coffee with women and gossip. She is very her own person. So, yes, a typical woman in a family is my grandmother. This old-fashioned idea of a housewife, mother, I don’t know what. My mother also cooks. But in the house it is not like that, that it would be obvious that she cooks. And she and father also took turns cooking. For example, now it is the father who cooks more often, because he is more thrilled about it. And he enjoys it more, apparently.  |*| 26 | (*| *| ) |*| 28 | R: Yes this is a fact. When they fought, this feeling that he things that without him everything can be destroyed, was often present. And with that he sometimes, not blackmail, but that he thinks that he has a power over me and brother and mother because of that. Financial power. That my mother couldn’t provide for us if they got divorced. In this sense he considers her a bit helpless. Or incapable. That too, yes. Here you can notice this male pride, that he earns more money. Some sort of conviction that he keeps everything together.  |*| 30 | R: Very powerful (laughing). Because she is a very liberal woman. I don’t know, sometimes she was also very hurt, right, and then she started thinking, that maybe she is really not so capable, or that she attributes less because she earns less. And things like that. But I think that this has changed very much and that she became much stronger and she knows, this is not the point. And father has also changed a lot since me and my brother went away to study and we are not at home so much. I think that also the father let go of his role of strong father and the head of the family. Now they are more like two personalities, separated. Each does something, they live together, but they have their own lives and the concentrate more on that. There is no more structure and this position of the family. Father, mother, I don’t know.  |

Maybe this is again my perception, because sometimes I can be a bit negative, so I have a feeling that some professors look at female students differently. I also get some remarks, you know. Not sexual, but some remarks that were based on the fact that I am a woman and not a man. And I was bothered by that. Especially on few oral exams. |*| 5 | R: The conversation was about some poem, erotic poem, it was literature exam, and I got a feeling from the professor that he wanted to embarrass me with this question. He was discussing this erotica and I think he expected me to be in an somehow awkward position. |*| 6 | (*| *| ) |*| 8 | R: I felt a bit abused. Not abused, but that this person wanted to put me in an uncomfortable position. But I got over it. I said what I learned and read about this poem. And I ignored it. Because to argue with a professor is not really smart (laughing), especially on oral exam. But yes, I was in shock. But this are different things. One professor also came drunk to the exam. And he openly looked into women’s breasts (laughing). But these are extremes. Or not, I don’t know. Excesses.  |*| 10 | R: No, I think not. But I think that some fellow student use this. In a sense, that for an exam they wear really low-cut cleavages, or a little skirt that wouldn’t wear every day. I experienced that already, that they came with cleavages that were really emphasized. While me, I don’t know, I want to come less womanly to an oral exam. I think that this actually has an influence. It is a fact that some professors change grades based on pretty eyes (laughing). Or pretty cleavages or whatever.  |*| 11 | (*| *| ) |*| 13 | R: No, I don’t think so. But some cases are really obvious. Maybe I am again an exception, because I don’t associate so much with my fellow students. I don’t hang out with everybody, I have a few friends and we hang out. But you can hear conversations. For example, a final exam before diploma on department of polish language was very interesting. One female fellow student posted on Facebook. I am convinced about her that she didn’t deserve 9, based on her knowledge she has shown in past 4 years. And she wrote a dialogue from this exam on Facebook and she somehow bragged about it. Again the dialogue was about erotic poetry, it seems that a lot of professors like this kind of literature. I don’t know. Why some poet has so many erotic motifs in his poetry. Well, he really has a lot of erotic motifs in his poetry. It is obvious and if it is on the exam it should be discussed. And then her answer was “Well, because this is something we all like, right, haha.” And then the professor said: “Yes, you are right, hahahaha.” This is something I consider manipulation, flirting, I don’t know.  |*| 15 | R: Yes. Because who doesn’t like that. And the professor accepted that. |*| 17 | R: Yes, I mean, not as an answer, but maybe as a little joke, it was totally acceptable. And that at the end she got a 9 for this kind of thing, for me that is very questionable. Because I know other female students that really have a lot of knowledge about literature and really prepared themselves and they got 7 on the same exam. So this case was very questionable for me, especially if (laughing) somebody brags about it. This is really beneath me. I rather have 7 than a 9 that I get in this manner. But it happens, definitely. |

No, they are also separated. We lived together until my 6th year, and then the mother and I moved out. Father was rugged, choleric, so I loved my mother more, I associated with her more. My father came to visit me sometimes or we went together somewhere, but I was much more attached to my mother than to my father.  |*| 7 | R: More or less. |*| 9 | R: Something like that. |*| 11 | R: No, no, it was never like that. I never felt deprived of something, that living just with a mother was some sort of a minus. Because a lot of people was in the similar situation. And it was not a big deal. |*| 13 | R: Yes, he lost his temper immediately, he started to yell at me immediately. I was actually afraid of him. When I was younger I didn’t like to go see him, I didn’t feel comfortable there. |*| 15 | R: Well, not really. He did slapped me a couple of times and I told that at home and then he was not allowed to see me for some time. Often was like that, he taught me how to screw, because he is like that, this old school, screwing and repairing and like that. And he would taught me to screw and if I bender a screwdriver he immediately started to shout at me, if I am dumb and things like that. And later I got aversion against this kind of work, I felt disgust. This typical male works. I don’t even hang out with peers that are like that. I became more of a gentle boy.  |*| 17 | R: I think so, surely this is the consequence.  |*| 19 | R: Yes, yes, yes. Yes, yes. Very much in this way. |*| 21 | R: Screwing and slings and little solders, things like that. There were also pluses, I don’t want only to criticize.

Well, I know how to repair a flat tire on a bike, but no, no.  |*| 24 | (*| *| ) |*| 26 | R: Well, I am interested in other things. I was never interested in cars and things like that, but I always enjoyed sculpting and drawing. And music, I played the piano. More artistic direction. |*| 28 | R: Well, maybe they are. How to put it? What I mean is that I am not interested in these typical things, such as cars, screwing and mechanics. These things, which were always more typically male.  |*| 30 |  R: Well, typically female is cooking or something like that. But this is nonsense. It is relative. But if I have to name typically female, I would say cooking, for example. And not physical work. Although they also do physical work.  |*| 31 | (*| *| ) |*| 33 | R: Yes, yes. She also has a good job, she works at (name institution), she is a lawyer. She is like that. |*| 35 | R: She never mentioned something like that. She is mad because her co-workers are asses, but men as well as women. She never mentioned that one sex as being guilty. Or that she is disadvantaged because she is a woman. Or something like that. |*| 37 | R: Well, I was with them a lot. My mum worked a lot so I spent a lot of time with granny and grandpa. But now I can’t remember what was their influence.  |*| 39 | R: Yes, yes, they had. |*| 41 | R: Yes, yes. It was so. They were like that. |*| 43 | R: Like that, grandma cooking, and grandpa screwing something. Just like that. He sat in front of the television and doing crosswords, grandpa cooking and cleaning. I have never seen grandpa cleaning. My grandma did all that. |*| 45 |  R: Well, they functioned like that, right. Grandma was not suffering or something, grandpa was not terrorizing her or anything. They organized things in this way and they were used to it and found them obvious and then there is no problem, if something is obvious and nobody feels oppressed in any way.  |

Because of that we haven’t had a chance for development since the very beginning. So, it was like that. These classical colours of femaleness are very obnoxious. |*| 7 | R: That I didn’t like about her? This unconditional, total attachment, when you have a feeling that the other person is living just for you. That you are the centre of her world and that only what you do matters, nothing else. So, the other always adjusts to you. I think this resemble going out with a zombie. So*| *|  These are some women who orient their whole identity to their partner and at the same time they loose any personality they have. And all that is left is willingness. So sad.  |*| 8 | (*| *| ) |*| *| ? |*| 10 |  R: Yes, that too, yes. I mean, I don’t mind that she cooks for me. This is great (laughing). But it is really really unpleasant that she totally devote to you. A zombie. And the problem whit the zombie is this complex of a good suffering mother. This devotion is not for free. |*| 12 | R: I didn’t get to know the price. Well the price is always this inner resentment. If this willingness is not returned with great gratefulness. These are two functions of a certain relationship and in any case you can only go crazy.  |*| 14 | R: Yes, zombie-ness in its self is not problematic. But this resentment of ungratefulness is an ugly head of the zombie. When this devotion is not just devotion, but it expects something in return. It is not pure devotion. Although on the other hand is total devotion. Anything of her own personality is gone. Just resentment, this is her only personal trait and this is problematic. The only thing on this person, you are with, is resentment. And this is quite unattractive.  |*| 16 | R: I think that actually it is not. It is still given out of love, affection. But you can never, ever pay for it, it is not possible, while it is a total devotion which can only be paid with total devotion. But it in never paid because the absolute can not be given all at once. She is giving all the time but she only get little pieces in return. Unrealistic expectations. And I think this is quite common syndrome of a number of women who still cling to this old, old division of roles of men and women. |*| 18 | R: I think it is not a female trait, it is more a trait of position, a trait of structural position. As well as tiredness after work is not a male trait but a trait of function. The fact that you worked 8 hours as a lunatic. If you put a woman into the same position, the same happens. And if a man would have to serve a woman all the time, as men actually do, then he also feels this resentment when he’s not getting unconditional, endless, absolute love in return. This is purely a question of structural place.  |

I don’t really have any significant experiences to be limited or in advantage as a man. I don’t have a feeling to be. The only thing that happened at the end of December was a seminar about feminism. And a feminist group forbid us an entrance to an evening with women. They had their own evening. (laughing) |*| 5 | R: A disadvantage, yes. I mean, this is very banal case, but... |*| 7 | R: I thing that a reason is understandable. An argumentation was not explicit, though, but I think that behind all that is the fact that in modern society close to 90% of activities are based on men. And that this wouldn’t happen on the seminar, which was dedicated to feminism, one evening was dedicated to women so they can have female things, female activities. Where there is nothing that can be thrown into a basket of the usual, which is always actually a male prevailing behaviour.  |*| 8 | (...) |*| 10 |  R: I go there for a few years and every year there is a different topic. And this topic was at that time, so. |*| 12 | R: Yes, yes, every year there is something else. |*| 13 | (*| *| ) |*| *| ) When talking about male – female and for example this feminist seminar. Did you start to think about certain advantages that you have as a male? That you didn’t notice before? |*| 15 | R: Yes, there was an advantage. But is a kind of untypical advantage. The thing was that at this particular seminar there were almost no clich*| é*|  women, like reading Cosmo and drinking cocktails. But this ladies night was precisely like that. For this clich*| é*|  women and then they would all gossip and talk about who likes which guy and these things. And we (referring to men) played cards and drink outside in the bar. And most of the women get bored in that company so they came to us to play cards and party. They didn’t want to be there. So it was an advantage. We didn’t have to change our behaviour when in female or in male company. On the other hand women had to change their behaviour in the company of women or of men. |*| 17 | R: We did the same things whether women were present or not. But they had to adapt to one form when in female company and to another form when with us. But in this case it was a coincidence, that they find our form of associating more familiar. If the case were the other way around they would have to adapt in our society and therefore rather go to the other party.  |*| 19 | R: Yes, yes. It was obvious that whatever we talked about equality and unnatural difference about male and female, it actually turned out that men were the centre of things. I think this was very unsuccessful experiment which actually strengthened everything we fought the whole week. |*| 20 | (*| *| ) |*| 22 | R: I think I can’t. Just according to specific population, not according labels and definitions. You have a group of people, and you have another group of people. Sexual difference in particular group is pure coincidence. It is a coincidence unless it is strongly culturally controlled. By us it is not controlled anymore but we had one Serb at a seminar who found this seminar absolute night mare. He was this typical Belgrade Serb. A total macho and I thought he will lose it every day. And everybody else was expecting the same and was ready to run. |*| 24 | R: Well, all those extreme English things with liberality and equality among men and women, which even to be it is sort of insanity, but to him*| *|  This total formalisation of relationships. He totally lost it the last evening, for new year’s. |*| *|  |*| 26 | R: Yes, he did, and then they forbade him to come to the seminar. They didn’t send him home, though, while it was nearly finished, but he totally lost it, started to curse and threatened someone. And the final thing was*| *|  He said that a women and men can’t be friends, if they spend a lot of time together this means only one thing. And these English lobbies got mad because of his opinion. They asked him whether he hasn’t got any girlfriends and he said he has but that they are not the same as his male friends. That they are just acquaintances. And this totally got on the other side’s nerves, how he segregates people. And they opposed him and he totally lost it. They said how to approach a woman that you would like to have a romantic relationship with. And he said that this is something you know after 2 or 5 minutes, you see if she is pleased and relaxed in your company. They said no, no, this can also mean friendship. It is not necessarily that. And the thing was that you have to ask. You have to ask a woman before kissing her if you can kiss her. That you have to, not that you can.  |*| *|  |*| 28 | R: This English, how to say, male feminists. And the Serb went totally ballistic. If they think if he is retarded, that he doesn’t know, when. That they are speaking to him as if he rapes a woman with that. The thing was this great mantra “No means no.” And it can only be if you actually ask before any potential sex assault might happen. And because of that they really insist on asking beforehand. And he totally lost it. This was a case of some sort of this classic, macho person, who understands a world in a way everything must be his way, that he is in charge. And the other extreme was again total extreme, formalisation of all human relations. I think this is a step away from the Serb’s position. His was a world, in which the functions of women and men are totally separated. But I think it is not the same in our case. |*| 30 | R: (laughing) At that time I did ask her for fun. For fun I did. I mean, the formality was fulfilled, whether for fun or not. But I like spontaneous relations, like relations always are. Always spontaneous. Whenever you enter a relation there is always this moment of uncertainty. This extreme wants to erase all uncertainty of this world. On one hand they want to de-formalise a human, like destroy your gender, be free as you are. And on the other hand*| *|  To be recognized you have to totally formalise all human relations. Which I find very I don’t know*| *|  Only a slight change of a system. Before you had a society in which some were discriminated and the other were privileged, they could decide about everything and the others didn’t have an ability of influencing that. Now those were not lifted to the position of being actually emancipated, to have the same power which was before given only to the other sex. Now this other sex is pushed down, because this is obviously easier to do. It is easier to dunk one side than to lift the other side. And I think therefore we will have two depressed sexes rather two emancipated sexes. So I think this is not the right logic.  |

I try not to have (laughing).  |*| 5 | R: Well this means I let him do half of house work. Although I still do more than half, right. But to do fifty-fifty at weekends. We distribute work. When it comes to the child, I do more, because I am still at home. |*| 7 | R:Yes (laughing). |*| 9 | R: Even though he knows and we have this agreement, he still wants to get out of it every Sunday. Like that. |*| 11 | R: No, no, not at all. But let’s say we are away the whole day and at the evening I expect us to do that, it is not a lot of work, half an hour each. And then he finds some reason, “I am tired,” “tomorrow”. And tomorrow never comes and this means I have to do it myself. So we usually argue, well, not too much, we have to have a quarrel and then it is. (laughing) |*| 13 | R: Most of the times. More times like that. And than we have a big fight and afterwards a talk and then it’s ok for let’s say two times, and then he forgets it again. |*| 15 | R: Well, he says that it’s a woman’s work, |*| 17 | R: Yes. And than I have to explain him over and over again that maybe it has been a woman’s work when men took care of the family and women stayed home and do house work. But now in the 21st Century it in not like that anymore. That is the way it is. (laughing) |*| 19 | R: He just cleans up. So I am pleased. |*| 21 | R: It is not a joke. He really thinks in this way. He still tries in some way to, but well now we are together for so long that he knows I won’t give in. But he still does.  |*| 22 | (...) |*| 24 | R: Well man’s work is to change a bulb, right, how often is that? Not every week for sure! What else is man’s work? Now when we were renovating, he had, I don’t know, the parquet. Well, we actually worked the same. I don’t know what could be specifically man’s work. Because even a car, I have my own car and I take care of it. It is not like he would take care of the cars, to take my car to the repair shop, to repair it, to clean it. It is not like that. So I don’t know, a man’s work during the week. O yes, he considers working at the garden a man’s work. But we don’t have a garden so (laughing). |*| 26 | R: Yes, yes, otherwise it would surely be very neat around the house (laughing).  |*| 27 | (*| *| ) |*| 29 | R: No, I don’t think so. No. No. For example, there are some weeks when there is a lot to do. Now one of the drains was blocked. He fixed it and then I did some more work. Because he spent so much time and during that time I cleaned up his part too. But that he would sit on the couch and I would clean up everything, that no. No. Because if we are equal when it comes to money, we have a common fond, we split all expenses in half. I can’t see why we couldn’t also split the work. We both like free time.  |*| 30 | (*| *| ) |*| 32 | R: Well I say, I am still at home. So I do most of the work. We will see what will happen in the future. |*| 34 | (she sees an ant on the wall, about that) |*| 35 | R: With the child is like that. I expected and wished that he would take some of the burden off of my shoulders when he comes home. So, to take him, to change his diapers, to cook something for him. But he didn’t. Well, he plays with him than we come somewhere together or I get him again. He has a practice three times a week in the afternoon, so he is with him for 2 hours and then he is off again. But for now the kid is so undemanding, that it’s no problem. Most of the time. Some days when I am really tired I would really appreciate some help. But for now it’s not too much of a problem for me.  |*| 36 | (*| *| ) |*| 38 | R: No, he didn’t give up anything. |*| 40 | R: No, actually from the beginning I started getting him used to that. First I had to give up some activities for medical reasons, because you deliver a baby. Then I did it. I go for volleyball once a week, like before, and during weekends I am a guide in the hills. So we did agree I will continue with that. Because as soon as I would give up something it would be the end. When you stop for a year it is hard to go back. To get them used to you needing some time for yourself. So as soon as I had a baby I decided not to let go here. I want time for myself. During the week it is me who spends most of the time with the kid, because he has practices, for the weekend I try to go away at least for a day. |*| 42 | R: Yes, at the beginning, when we came home the first day, he still went for practice. This hurt me a lot. |*| 44 | R: Yes, when we came home, you will see, the hormones are just bursting, I cried a lot. And I am usually no cry baby. But this hurt me really so much, that he went for practice, when we came home. You don’t know what to do with that baby. At the beginning you are lost. I was prepared though, but still. And then I instantly said that I will take time form myself as soon as I could. He will be with the little one and I will go. Because you know, as soon as you are present, you do all the work. As soon as he cries, “here you go.” When you are not present, he has to deal with it. And he manages all right, but it is easier to “here you go, mommy, take care of him”. And I told him “ok, you have your practices, you won’t give up.” He made that clear to me so I think it is no use to insist on it. And you do need a time for yourself. And I told him that I will go to volleyball and will be a guide and that I want to have some afternoon, when he comes home, so I can go to*| *| marna Gora alone with my girlfriends. Because it is entirely different if you drag a baby with you. So it didn’t actually last so long, then it was winter and short days so I had to go before he came home from work. And now, I don’t know, we go together or I go with the little one.  |*| 45 | (*| *| ) |*| 47 | R: No. I don’t know from where. I find it very unfair, that I should contribute the same amount to family fond plus do a lot more work and because of that have lesser free time. It is because of that. At my home it is very divided. Mother is a housewife, father takes care of technical things. But she is not technical type at all and she finds this ok. And she actually serves him. I don’t know, I don’t like it. I don’t like it this way.  |*| 49 | R: I don’t know. Maybe a bit. At home I found it quite off, when my father said, “where is the salt?” And instead of getting up and getting the salt from the kitchen that was closer to him, my mother got up and got him the salt. And I was like come on (laughing). He has two feet as well, why couldn’t he get up himself? |

And I went to 4 interviews and then they always hired a man. And it got me thinking, that me, I mean, not me, my age group and women, are not being employed, because it is expected that they will take a maternity leave. And that they will take a lot of sick leave. And based on that I also decided for maternity leave. Well, this was one of the reasons.  |*| 5 | R: I called back to ask about two jobs and they told me they rather hire a man if they have the opportunity.  |*| 6 | (*| *| ) |*| 8 | R: Well, very bad (laughing, silence). Totally without any rights. Because you really can’t do anything if you are a woman. I do understand the employers, because it is true. If there are so many women in teachers’ room, it is a hennery, in quotes. It is better to have something like fifty fifty or balanced. But the reason that it is expected to take maternity leave and sick leave, this hurt me the most. |*| 10 | R: No. I didn’t even consider having one. But then when I saw I can’t get another job and I already had a full-time job, I decided to have one. Because of that as well. Not just because of that.  |*| 11 | (*| *| ) |*| 13 | R: Well because I think I work well. In the last 8 years I have had just one week of sick leave. So less than some of my male colleges. Ok, for a year I am on maternity leave, but it is no problem to get a substitute for a year. And even if I would have to be on sick leave more often because of the baby, a father can also take it, just like me. So here we are totally equal. And it hurt me, because just because I am a woman they instantly took one opportunity away from me.  |

But this is based on the fact that alpine climbing is very connected with strength, ok, not just with that. But, men are stronger, this originates here. |*| 7 | R: Yes, a little bit of joke and a little bit of truth. |*| 9 | R: Yes, they are sometimes. For example if a boy and a girl go climbing together, it is usually anticipated that if there are some difficulties a man will go ahead. Although it is not always like that. But if a woman goes ahead, usually it is not talked about. If a man goes ahead it is something that is very much talked about (laughing). |*| 11 | R: Yes, no, no. This is quite bad for ego. Yes.

I went to work earlier than he and he took care of the children and took them to kindergarten. If I worked the whole day, he went to pick them up and took care of them. He also changed their diapers and always helped me. He takes care of the groceries now. The financial part is entirely his responsibility. (*| *| ) I remember when we went on vacations, to the sea, we stayed in a trailer. I was with the boys by the seaside, when they were still young. He was translating already back then, or he always had with him some other work, he studied. And I remember they said to me: “are you alone, madam, on vacation?” (laughing)  |*| 4 | R: Yes, yes. But I was able to (silence) organise everything. You miss that later, when the boys are older and than you feel this absence. Than you feel the absence, therefore it is necessary to work on relationship. From the beginning.  |*| 6 | R: Some common activities. You do function as a parent. It is not a problem to be a parent, we always functioned as parents. The problem is a relationship. And children need an example of a relationship. To see you how you communicate about feelings, about state of mind. |*| 7 | (*| *| ) |*| 9 | R: No, I think*| *|  Yes, this is a good question. When I was preparing my diploma on higher education, I also conducted a qualitative research. I had a lot to do. And I told him many times. The boys were at the end of primary school, 6., 7. grade. Independent in a way but still needing you. If he would come home earlier, because at that time he was coming home at 7 pm. He was absent the whole day. And I got the answer, that in the family it is not possible for two people to make research. If they don’t have the help from grandmother or some other possibility. I know I lost it at the time and I closed myself in the room and did my analysis. I was simply not available. If I wouldn’t close myself and worked, it already took me about three months of intensive work, I would have never finished it. |*| 11 | R: No, I didn’t. I stopped ironing, I stopped doing everything. I stopped doing everything so at the end they ironed their clothes themselves. I didn’t clean, nothing. |*| 13 | R: No, it was accepted as such and afterwards he was satisfied because my diploma was quite significant. I noticed that he even bragged himself. (laughing) But I didn’t get any support, that is true. Considering he also does other thing besides his occupation all the time. |*| 15 | R: Not good. Bad. And I approached him with that numerous times. I let him know. This was the only thing where I was not given any support. He gave kinds money, “you go and buy something.” But that is not the point. You have to be physically present as well. |*| 17 | R: It is not like that. |*| 19 | R: He didn’t have to, while other things were taken care of by themselves.

I don’t know if you are familiar with camping life. Children are camping and then they go home and parents with small children come to the same camping site and we went there together. And it is adapted to small children. And then a few of us who enjoyed hiking to the hills went hiking on our own once per week. And I can remember once we had a really great experience. I went from our family, my husband took care of the children, and men from other families also went. I don’t know how many of us were there, 10 families or even more. And when we came back two of the men that we hang out together, said “we should go again tomorrow”. And the wives said immediately “no, that’s it, we are here on family vacation and you will not be on your own”. And I still remember today, and it must be, I think I wasn’t even 30 at the time. I was thinking how can they be so narrow minded not to let them go, since they of course need some time for themselves. Because I never opposed my husband to go. Because in a way I understood him, I understood that he needs that. Afterwards he was filled with energy and he was able to dedicate more to us. Maybe it was because from time to time I also needed time of my own, to go away, and I didn’t sit at home. Maybe if I sat at home I would*| *|  |

We didn’t associate much, but I went to see her sometimes. She was this fine urban lady with a lot of memories about pre-war (referring to the WW2) times. Which was kind of interesting to me and on the other hand not familiar to me, while I grew up in socialism. It was not familiar to me. But she was a lady. A woman, a lady. She went to the opera prior to the war, she smoked, was always neat, always wore lipstick, although she was always inside. (laughing) On the other hand, my other grandma, which was not my real grandmother, while my mom’s parents died when she was a baby and another family took care of her.

This was very early for those times. I was 5 years old.  |*| 13 | R: There were. Also a female family friend had a 850. Fi*| è*| ko was 70, and she had a 850, which was larger. Still small but big for those times. (laughing) So I lived in a world of women who were very capable. Ours, I mean my mother was really capable. Later she bought a three-room apartment, on her own. When I went to school, we moved from family house to this flat because of the relations with her mother-in-law.  |*| 15 | R: independent. I can’t remember that we ever lacked anything. I didn’t get a high pension from my father (her father died when she was 1 year old), because he was still a student. And he didn’t have any particular income, so I didn’t get much from him. I mean, my mother got it. But she could really do tricks with money! But it is also true she worked really hard. It was a praxis at a time to work full day twice a week. And she was a worker, she was uneducated.  |*| 16 | (*| *| ) |*| 18 | R: None.  |*| 20 | R: No, I don’t recall anything. For real. She had two great girlfriends, they have been together since puberty or adolescence. And they are still friends. A three-leafed shamrock. One is single and she is approximately 4 or 5 years older. She had this 850 car. The other one was also a widow, they (referring to this girlfriend and the respondent’s mother) were widows at the same time. She also lived with a daughter, that was a few years older than me. And she had great support in the family and also in her late husband’s family. They supported her financially. But I saw my mother, she managed everything on her own. (*| *| ) |*| 21 | (...) |*| 23 | R: Well, you have a certain pattern to be able to organise everything and nothing seems to hard. I have it. Although I already have two grown up children, but still. I think I had a role model at home. My mother took care of everything in our family. I remember when we were building our weekend house, I was around 10, 11, 12 years old. And we had these community actions where everybody comes to help with bigger works, like digging for electricity, water and alike, across meadows. But I remember, a builder was building, my mother stood by the cement mixer and made cement, and I took the cement to the builder with a wheelbarrow. I have this recollection. She always bought everything by herself, she took care of everything. When pops, I called him pops (referring to her step father) came home, everything was already taken care of. He just made some mess. (laughing) |*| 25 | R: No. At our house my mother took care of everything. When I was 18 she bought me katra (Renault 4). Well, we both drove it. We had this Fi*| è*| ko for 2 years I think, when my step father came to live with us without a car. (laughing) And he had a good job. And when I was 10, stoenka (Zastava 101) was bought, but as far as I know my mother contributed most of the money. But then he drove it, he was after all a gentleman. (ironically) Well, and then when I was 18 my mother said I shouldn’t ask to borrow a car all the time and she bought this katra. Which I could drive whenever I wanted. (laughing) But then another one was bought, so I had my own and she had her own. So I don’t have this division.  |

Although less than in the past. While a breast is still a symbol of femininity and sexuality and besides that a cancer is an additional stigma. Also the association of death. I went through it quite well, I don’t know. I think there are a few of us that are like that. I also volunteer and I must say*| *|  It is also true that today is frequently spoken and written about it. Back then, when I was sick, you didn’t hear a lot about it, not at all. Very rarely you could hear something about it. (silence) I don’t know. Even if they actually accept it. Ok, the procedures now are also very different, it is done more elegantly. In the past it was necessary to remove the whole breast. But it is like that, cancer, right? A word that is fearful. I don’t know. I was with two women a while ago; one was 28, the other 40. And they were very frightened. And the doctor called me, if they can contact me. And than, after I spoke with them and when they got the information about the disease, their fear went away. I think that talking about it helps a lot. And back then I have spoken to myself. During my workday I went and I had mammography. Or something like that, I can’t really recall. I know I went during my workday and I found out it was cancer and I went straight back to work. (laughing) And my co-worker asks me “what was it?” And I said “cancer.” They were totally shocked. I remember one of them started to cry. And I must say I was fine. Nothing special. I was sure I will get better. That it is quite early and I will get better. (silence) So, I don’t know. And at that time I also considered breast reconstruction. A new breast from my own tissue. And the thought of that was like a psychological crutch. I see that now. For a few months. And it was also helpful for my kids. I know they kept asking me “when will you get a new breast?” But then the thought of that kept drifting away. We were nudists and we are still nudists. At that time I was covering myself up. Well, you can’t be covered up all the time. But I noticed people are accepting me in a way. They asked me “how do you feel? Are you well?” The ones we kept seeing for years. So people taught me. And also kids taught me. When we were with Scouts, I distanced myself a bit, because I experienced a shock. We camped in two groups. And the first group, I had my surgery a month earlier. And I remember I was really hurt by what happened. There were quite a few doctors in our camp and my arm was swollen and on Institute of Oncology they didn’t tell me that this is a possibility. And we were besides the (name river) and I pulled my shirt up and asked one of the female doctors “look, what is this?” “Watch out, children are present!” And I remember I was really hurt. I said “if anybody is suffering it is my own two children.” So I distanced and withdrawn myself. I bathe separately. The scar was very fresh.  |*| 8 | R: I don’t know. Yes, I understood it like that. It is scary and they will see. It is scary, right. But my two children saw it and didn’t say it was scary or run away screaming in fear. Well, and then the other group came next week and I said I will withdrawn myself because of that experience. And they said “no, no, no, really, don’t!” And we bathe together and then children from 3 to 10 years of old came, around 8 of them. And they looked “what is this?” And I explained to them age appropriately. “I see, they did it like that!” And each of them took a look and some of them asked about it and they went away. I learned from those kids that it is in your head. |*| *|  |*| 10 | R: They have a message. And are very honest. |*| *|  |*| 12 | R: Norms, yes. So this was a lesson to me and then also the nudist beach, I mean, this camp. And so the thought of reconstruction drifted away. After a few months I realized that I am totally good the way I am. My husband never gave me any signals, that I am not a woman anymore or anything like that. I also noticed I am still as seductive as before, because I did wear prosthesis. I was interesting for men. I felt that. |*| 14 | R: Yes, yes, yes... |*| 16 | R: ... Yes, yes, yes. That I am still a woman. And one of the lessons also happened in that camp. There were always the same people. And there was also one woman and she said “my sister works at plastic surgery, we can go and see her about reconstruction.” Because I was really into getting reconstruction at that time. So we went across the camping site and when coming closer to her she says “isn’t it a shame to lose such a stomach!” And I thought to myself “she is strange, what is she talking about a stomach!” I did know that they take a part of your stomach, but I didn’t realize it leaves such an ugly scar. (*| *| ) |*| 17 | (*| *| ) |*| 18 | R: (*| *| ) When you are young (she was 33), everybody was telling me “yes you should have a reconstruction, you are so young.” Only my surgeon didn’t say that to me. He was an older gentleman, who retired afterwards. I am very grateful to him. He would just look at me and I would run across the street and make appointment for reconstruction. He was the only one who said “well, you will see.” He didn’t say “go!” |*| 19 | (*| *| ) |*| 20 | R: (*| *| ) People pity you a lot, because what happened to you. Everybody, I think. I saw in that camp. Afterwards I gained some self esteem. And I walked really erect. (laughing) And I saw that although they looked at me they saw me as a woman. Whole. Not like something is missing. I also dressed like that. I remember that bright colours were really helpful. I wore very bright colours. I know I had a bright yellow miniskirt, and bright blue bellybutton-shirt. (laughing) I remember this. But it was on a subconscious level. And I recall I used to go swimming in September because I needed to recreate my arm, while they removed my lymphatic glands. And I went to (name town), to (name coast), I walked very proud, wearing these high heals (laughing), full of myself. And there were these three lads, I imagined them being body guards at a disco doors. (laughing) Good lookers, right. (laughing) And one of them followed me. And I thought to myself “just wait, you will see alright!” (laughing) And I went to these rocks and he went to these other rocks. And I positioned myself in a way (laughing) that he couldn’t see anything. And I undressed myself. He sat 5 meters away and he looked at me constantly. And I was flirting with him a bit (laughing), but kept myself covered up just enough. And I had a plan: “if you are a real man, you won’t be scared by this.” But he was. This was the only such experience. I also had longer hair so everything was covered up. And I slowly started to walk into the sea. And he sees me and starts doing the same. And at the very end I lifted my arms, I don’t even know, what I did, and he sees it. (laughing) And it was not ugly at all. I already had a nice scar. But I was flat. And he jumped into the water and swam away. I thought to myself “jerk!” This was the only such message. But I must say I wasn’t hurt, I had fun. I still have fun remembering it. But otherwise I think people accept you. (*| *| ) |*| 21 | (*| *| ) |*| 22 | R: (*| *| ) For approximately two months I considered to have a reconstruction. But then there were these messages: what about the stomach, and the children: “So this was done to you.” The younger child said to me when I came home: “let me see what they have done.” I was embarrassed, should I do it or not. “So if they haven’t cut it off, you would have died?” And we never spoke about death. He was 7 yrs. So I realized when you are open about it and you talk about it people open up and come towards you. |*| 23 | (*| *| ) |*| 24 | R: My cousin’s wife had an operation a few years before me and they offered her it (reconstruction) immediately. To do it right away. And she had both surgeries at the same time. I didn’t see it, I just saw good looking bumps. And when I was getting the surgery I went to visit her and she showed it to me. And it was really beautiful. She had these heavy, strong breasts, African, very upwardly. But she didn’t show me this scar (on her stomach). Nobody talked about it, they all just look at your upper body, and how it is beautiful. She also said “yes it is very hurtful, but this comes along.” I don’t know. So I also considered having it done. “If they remove it they will make me a new one.” And also everybody was telling me “yes you must do it, of course you will do it.” Including the doctors. But it includes numerous things. It might. Not necessarily. |*| 26 | R: Yes, entirely. Entirely cosmetic. And if there is not enough tissue they put an implant in. Artificial. An implant with physiological solution or silicone. |*| 28 | R: Yes, yes, yes. Well, I thing that this is for a man, who grabs you from behind and has both of his hands on them. (laughing) But how much you feel, I don’t know. First, it is very connected with pain, I think so. I think that you are in a lot of pain for quite a few months. Second, the sensibility. I don’t know if it is sensible. For example, for me it is already 14 years and some parts around the scar are still not sensible. The nerve endings are disrupted. They just don’t have to wear the prosthesis and that they don’t think it will fall out.  |*| 29 | (*| *| ) |*| 31 | R: Yes, I go out. Yes, yes. At home I don’t wear it and usually for sports. And when I take out the garbage, in an apartment building from 10th floor I usually go to the elevator without it. I don’t have (problems) with that. We also have a small house in (name town2). And I bathe beneath the church. I don’t have a problem without that. |*| 33 | R: No. |*| 35 | R: No, no. I think to myself “go ahead and look!” What if I wouldn’t have an arm? (*| *| ) |

My sister is 10 years younger, I am the older one. I think that especially my mother made a difference between the sexes, I won’t say she exactly forced me, but she expected more from me in a way. I could say so. |*| 5 | R: In a sense*| *|  Although my sister finished university, Faculty of mechanical engineering quite well, on time and everything. But I felt that they wanted more for me to gain some life goals, career, school. |*| 7 | R: Yes, I think so. Especially mother was like that. She has more patriarchal background. I think she comes from the context where more is expected from men.  |*| 9 | R: Yes, more important. Certainly. This is quite present with by my mother. And even now, she still lives in Beograd, she is 81 years old. Very healthy, today it’s her birthday. And now we went to Marathon of Belgrade and my two kids from my first marriage went with me. And she praises my (name son) more than granddaughter. It is horrible in a way, but that’s how it is. I try to control her in doing that, though, but I see that probably it was the same with me and my sister. And (name son) is an angel, right, and she (referring to his daughter) is a competition in a way. I don’t know how to interpret it. |*| 11 | R: Yes. |*| 13 | R: Yes, maybe. It is hard to say, but certainly*| *|  Less strict probably, and on the other hand demanding more. It is hard to define it. |*| 14 | (*| *| ) |*| 18 | R: I don’t know, every other thing is hold against (name daughter), “don’t yell,” “don’t do that,” “don’t interfere,” “don’t disrupt the conversation.” And meanwhile my (name son) can interfere with the conversation 10 times and it will be all right. In that way.  |*| 20 | R: Yes, before it escalates to maximum I tell her to take it easy with that attitude, but it is hard. It is hard to stop it. And as I said, it has been the same for all these years. |*| 22 | R: Yes, it is hard. It is hard for sure, while we don’t see each other so often and you convince your daughter that granny loves her. And than it comes to situations like that. Of course at the end everything it sorted out, but not always.  |*| 24 | R: Yes she does, of course. We were there a few days ago and she cried. It was again how (name son) is better than she is. Ugly (laughing). What can you do? |*| 25 | (...) |*| 27 | R: (Name son) will be 15 in June, (name daughter) will be 11 in October.  |*| 29 | R: No. |*| 31 | R: No, I don’t think so. Well, they go along quite normally, although they quarrel sometimes.  |*| 33 | R: Because of that? |*| 35 | R: Well, yes, yes. Sometimes (name daughter) says “You are the angel, and I am the ugly one.” It is not fair. But she doesn’t attack him or anything.  |*| 37 |  R: Of course.  |*| 38 | (*| *| ) |*| *| ? |*| 40 | R: Well, I would say no. My mother had a job as well. She was a professor of Serbo-Croatian language and literature. But for my father I could say he was a scientist. He worked a lot, in the afternoon, in the evening, whole nights. So she let him do his things and she took care of the household. But I remember, though, when me and my sister were small, there was no special cooking going on during the week, we went to a restaurant with our pots and we took our meals home. There was no time. And we could still manage financially.   |*| 42 | R: No, not at the time. Maybe later, when the kids grew up and she had more time. But also my father helped, it was not like he didn’t do anything. But he had his freedom to be involved with physics and mathematics.  |*| 44 | R: Yes, she was more involved with the children. |*| 46 | R: Of course, she finished university. Language and literature. But still, she was traditional mother in a way.  |*| 48 | R: Yes, she did. Many times she tells the same story I heard for million times already. About her BA thesis, which was of high quality and dealt with old Croatian literature, with first written documents of language from island Hvar. (*| *| ) And her mentor advised her to develop and analyse this topic some more and write a MA or PhD thesis. And yes, I was not ambitious enough and then the child came and obligations. I think that the regrets are present. Somewhere. But it is not too much of a burden. |*| 50 | R: No, I don’t think so. I think it was nothing like that. She only said she could accomplish something in this direction. As a student she also worked at a radio station, doing child plays, and she said she could also go into this direction. At the end she taught at an automobile school centre. And in every generation she found a student who was more interested. Because these boys were not particularly interested in language, art. But you could find some and she was really reinvigorated. And in these little sparks I could see that maybe she nevertheless would have wished to work in her field more. But she accepted the reality as it was. |*| 52 | R: Well, no. No, no, we talked a lot. I couldn’t say that there were some severe causes and that she would then madly told that. No. I don’t remember that.  |

Every other weekend and once a week. That’s how we have it. And vacation and going to the sea side, two separate weeks or maybe 10 days. And sometimes in between. To go skiing. It’s like that. |*| 7 | R: Well, we have an agreement, but I also found it that it is a standard, so to speak. Yes, we have an agreement. And we also wrote it down and signed it in this contract. |*| 9 | R: Yes, we agreed on it. |*| 11 | R: Well, I will put it like that, what can I do? This is some kind of societal consensus, right. So, this is it. |*| *| ? |*| 13 | R: Yes, it would be nicer if they were with me, of course. But it is like that, this is momentary praxis. What can you do? |*| 15 | R: Well, we had such cases, where was it? In Koro*| *| ka. (Referring to recent events in Slovenia. A father didn’t want to give his daughter to her mother (they were divorced), while there was an investigation regarding the mother’s father about possible sexual abuse of the girl. The court however decided that the girl should go live with her mother. Because the father didn’t want to hand over his daughter, police (unofficial information state that there were more than 30 policemen) dashed into his house to take away the little girl. There is still no legal epilogue, but the case started a debate in general as well as professional public whether the praxis of mother usually getting the child after the divorce is in the best interest of the child). Yes, sometimes I think that this praxis has no real point in the case of relatively older children. It is too predetermined. And of course children can become some sort of lever to accomplish different goals. But you can’t do anything; it is the way it is. From biological standpoint it is probably right, especially with very young children, to stay with the mother. If the case is not extreme, if there is no alcohol involved and such things.  |*| 17 | R: Well, there was not a real debate about it. Yes, understood as such without saying. I could say so. It is usually like that. Most of the times. I never expressed any disagreement or to oppose or written this opinion down officially. I didn’t go into this direction, because it would even worsen the things. And children are only children for a limited time, until they grow up. And it wouldn’t be nice for them to live under pressure, in the middle of quarrelling.  So you decide for something rationally.  |*| 18 | (*| *| ) |*| *| ? |*| 20 | R: Is marginalised, yes, he is. Most certainly he is marginalised. Emancipation, of course. Yes, he is in some sort of inferior position but*| *|  Maybe, we will see how the society evolves, what will happen with public opinion. Maybe it will go to the other direction. Or maybe we will meet in the middle. Or what will happen. Someday.  |

I couldn’t deny it, it must be something like that. |*| 13 | R: Yes. Yes. Actually I will put it like that: I did feel a tendency that she wanted to take the initiative and activate her self more and start to be involved more but it was really hard because the children were small. Before that she didn’t take this sport so seriously. Later, now she is quite serious. I did feel some, I would say, initiatives. I wasn’t against them, when the conditions were right, of course.  |*| 15 | R: Surely it is. For sure.  |*| 17 | R: Yes, it was that also. Sure. But with others*| *|  I climbed with other women too.

Is the climbing the only reason? I don’t think there is some explicit sexual offer, but some*| *|  I don’t know. Maybe. I know a few people that climb almost only with women. Almost only with them. So I don’t know. Or at least very often, compared to me.

And this philosophy caused me great difficulties, because I knew that if I would want to seriously deal with philosophy as I did during my studies, I would have to dedicate my whole life to it. I saw it like that. And I studied in National library and there I had one college with whom I always sat together and went to lunch, but I couldn’t imagine him as a lover. Because he was my friend, right. Well, and then we met each other at one jazz festival and all of a sudden we realised that we were in love. He sent me love letters before that but I ignored them, while we were friends. Well, and then we finished university together and they invited me to another department at the Faculty of Arts. If I would want to lecture pedagogic philosophy, because current professor was going to retire, and I could be his assistant for his last year and than take over his classes. I graduated in ethics. Well, and I say: “yes, I will think about it.” At that time I just started to live with my partner. He also had a degree but nobody invited him anywhere.  |*| 3 | (*| *| ) |*| 4 | R: (*| *| ) After three quarters of a year after his diploma nobody asked him and he sat at home. And I found my job already before diploma, because I couldn’t stay in (name city), if I didn’t have any income. Well, and then I got a call from this professor, who was going to retire, if I would come and I say “yes, yes, I will”. But I was tactically delaying, because I waited for my partner to get a call, while he was a straight A student and really talented for philosophy. And then he got a call from one professor, who said “Would you come to pedagogic school in (name city2)?” And he said “(Name city2)?” It was beneath him. “No, I won’t go to (name city2).” And another half a year passed. And they called me at home asking why I am delaying? I ought to say yes or no. And I was saying maybe, and constantly avoiding them. Well, and finally after one year my partner was invited to be an assistant at department of philosophy. And I said, “Now I am free.” Because I was delaying because of him, I found it unfair that I would go to university and he wouldn’t. He was a real straight A student and everything. Really talented for this domain. And then after three months or so I go for a meeting. And I announce myself to this professor and I wanted to say “yes, I will come.” But 10 days prior to the meeting I found out I was pregnant. And at that moment I thought to myself: “what do I care about philosophy?” I realised I am not interested in that. And I went to see this professor and I said “you know what, I am pregnant, so it is out of the question.” And he said “It doesn’t matter, we can postpone it for a year!” “No, no,” I said, “I am interested in having a family. I am not interested in scientific career at all.” Because I ought to do MA and PhD right away. I saw what was going on at our house. There had to be silence for 12 hours a day, because he was writing and working. He got his PhD before he was 30. I was instantly not interested anymore. I was happy to have that job. |*| 5 | (*| *| ) |*| 6 | R: (*| *| ) I realised I made the right decision. Because I wouldn’t be able to make the two, to have a career and to have a family. I wanted family over a career. But back then I didn’t know that. When I found out I was pregnant, it was clear. Nobody forced me to do anything, they were willing to wait. I realised, that from my point of view the two were not compatible.  |*| 7 | (...) |*| 8 | R: (...) Science is a great luxury. Because you have to have a financial means for a living. If you don’t have that, you have to work and this is reflected somewhere, psychological disorders, it is reflected somewhere. Maybe the children are being neglected; I am familiar with many such cases. I lived in such a family, mother and father were working or having appointments for 15 hours a day. I grew up by myself. And I didn’t want that. Not at all. So, it wasn’t associated with that, that I would think that scientific career is not appropriate for a woman. Not at all. If I had a lot of money and some help at home, it would be possible for me to work 5 hours in the morning for my masters and PhD and not neglect my family. |*| 10 | R: It was not to expect from him to financially support his family. |*| 12 | R: He worked as an assistant. As an assistant he had a salary of 90.000, but we had to pay for our apartment 120.000 per month. He had a 90.000 assistant salary. And we lived like that until our divorce. |*| 14 | R: Yes, yes. |*| 16 | R: No, nooooo. |*| 17 | (...) |*| 19 | R: He said “decide for your self.” He never had any special relation to the money.

When I was a child we lived in (name city), in a small town, in one one-storey house and there were three girls. I was the oldest and two younger. And we always played with dolls on our yard. Across the yard was a big house. (*| *| ) And there were these boys, who were older than we were and they constantly played hide and seek. This was very great. This game was very popular, hide and seek. And the three of us constantly begged them to join their game. (*| *| ) |*| 3 | (*| *| ) |*| 4 | R: They said “girls”, and we were also younger. They didn’t pay any attention to us. And we were greatly hurt. And in between there was a fence and two wood sheds. And in one of those was a halt, while they had a roof. So, we wanted so badly to be involved, but it was absolutely not possible. Well, and we played on this side of the fence with the dolls. And there was also one boy, who was a part of other boys’ group, who was approximately one year younger than me. So, when we were called in for lunch, he always climbed across this fence and destroyed everything we made. We had these rag-dolls we sewed and little apartments from stones. So, when we would come back from lunch, everything was always destroyed. And it was a lot of crying among us. (*| *| 6 | R: Yes, equal. Nobody told us anymore that we were too young, like “What do you want, little ones?” And girls. We played hide and seek and it was all good. |*| 8 | R: He was always on the side. He was very hurt about what happened. Because the whole yard, everybody knew about it. And most of them also heard him screaming “mommy”, when he was calling his mother, so everybody saw me pulling his hair. I didn’t hurt him so much, though. It was more of an embarrassment for him. Humiliation. |*| 10 | R: Yes, yes.  |*| 12 | R: Yes, he was, on the yard everybody was. But to stand out in any way latter or to tease us, he didn’t even think about it. And it stopped. Well, but I was thinking, this act was not an act of a girl. Not at all. |*| 14 | R: Physical strength that is attributed to men, right. (*| *| ) |

I had a brother, he was 8 years younger, but my brother, my brother was allowed to do everything. I was not. They had me under horribly strict control. (*| *| ) |*| 3 | (*| *| )  |*| 4 |   |*| 6 | R: Well, they never asked him anything, when he went out, right. He was allowed to go out. “He is a boy.” My mother said “he is a boy.” And then I went to (name city), I couldn’t wait to go, when I was 18. And during vacations I came home, because I always worked. I wouldn’t be able to study otherwise. In July and August I always had some kind of a job. And there were these dances at Brnik, at the basketball place Brnik. And these dances were fantastic and famed. But they started at 8, right. I had awful problems with that. Because at home, even though I was a student, 9 was the ultimate hour.  |*| 8 | R: Yes. Well, my brother was 8 years younger, he was a 16 years old boy, I had to be home at nine, and he came home in the morning (laughing). |*| 10 | R: They had some ideas, I don’t know what kind. I have no idea. Yes, these are prejudices. Like, a boy can wonder around, but something can happen to a woman. |*| 12 | R: Yes, to protect me. |*| 14 | R: No, no, no, no, no. Yes, of course, because I was a girl. |*| 16 | R: I had my own plan. Because when my brother was little, I was sort of his mother. Because an 8 years and a half is quite great age difference. |*| 17 | (*| *| ) |*| 19 | R: Yes. |*| 21 | R: Of course. I have cooked since I was 12. I cooked. I had to take my brother to the kindergarten. Sometimes I didn’t feel like cooking so I went to the canteen. This was the worst. To go to the canteen with these pots every morning. Going there was ok, though. I took my brother to the kindergarten, because my parents started their work at 6, back then the rhythm of life was totally different. So, when I went back, the worst thing was to carry these lunches, because the soup always. The pots were not good. It always sprayed on my legs. So, this was the worst. And besides that I also went to music school, I always had too many obligations.  |*| 23 | R: Yes, entirely different. Although, I can’t imagine that family, because we really cared for each other. I can’t imagine me having a sister. I never could. I was happy to have this brother. But he was always sort of a burden of mine. Of course. |*| 25 | R: Yes, yes. Of course. Precisely like that. Of course, of course. It was very much like that. If I were a boy and younger*| *|  well maybe he should just the same. If I were in his position, if the situation were reversed, it would be the same. |*| 27 | R: The older should take care of the younger, more like that. It was funny, though. I was a student and I had to be home at nine, my brother was in high school, his first year, and came home in the morning. Nobody said anything to him. These are prejudices that are connected with sex. They surely are.  |*| 29 | R: Mother, mother. Sure, father would, but mother wouldn’t let him. Yes yes. Because she was in charge of family matters. But when it came to me, it was my father.  |*| *|  |*| 31 | R: Yes, yes, father was more. But they were a family if I was 5 minutes late. They punched their watches like that (she punches her wrist with index finger a few times).  |

I also*| *|  when the kids were small. There were some things I never did when caring for children. I thought that these things were something a woman would know best. They are better in caring for children. On the other hand there are some things I know better as a father. (*| *| ) |*| 4 | R: All physical works. Back then we did a lot of house-repairing-work by ourselves, even some things that would now be considered as moonlighting. I can not imagine my wife to plaster walls. Or to drill walls for electrical installations, or to split firewood. I can’t imagine, although if you look at female farmers, they do all these things. I don’t know, I grew up like that. I could not imagine changing my babies’ diapers and wiping their bottoms, even bathing them. I did not. I wasn’t into it. But I played with them, took them for a walk, these kind of things. There are also works I have done since I was a child and are not beneath me. These female works. Clean up the room or to vacuum clean or to do the dishes. These are the works that are not beneath me, of course no kind of work is beneath me, if it must be done. Doing all kinds of work is ok if you help your family. These believes are probably connected to my upbringing and are in my head. Why do I think there are some things I wouldn’t do? If I had to, I would probably do them anyway.  |*| 5 | (*| *| ) |*| 6 | R: (*| *| ) A woman who has a child must dedicate at least some part of her life to the children, at least to the end of the primary school. That is until their 14 years of age. (*| *| ) |*| 7 | (*| *| ) |*| *| ? |*| 9 | R: You see, it is like that: it is impossible to divide raising children 50-50 among the man and the woman. Upbringing must be somehow balanced. Usually the woman prevails, and then she and her husband must communicate so they don’t do things differently. But I do think that upbringing is the family matter. But of course, one is prevailing, like they say for a woman. It is not evident, but she supports three corners of the house. Three. Meaning, she does most of the housework. When we talk about the house. When we talk about the career, it is then impossible to support three corners of the house. I think that the family is a community where certain tasks are already determined according to tradition. (*| *| ) |*| 10 | (*| *| ) |*| 12 | R: No, as I said, housework is not beneath me and if we did it together we were sooner able to go somewhere. It is like at work: let’s do this quickly so we can go home sooner. It is the same. So, some things I don’t find difficult to do. |*| 14 | R: No, it is not like that: woman with a broom and a man on the couch with a beer in his hands and a TV. I don’t know, I think that also this younger generation, they don’t have these habits and even the time. You see, sometimes people worked between 6 am and 2 pm. This was very important, you finished working at 2 pm or even sooner and you had your whole afternoon free. Maybe men did have more parties or they went moonlighting. Some worked hard. But there were also some who liked to lie down and rest. |*| 16 | R: This is connected with my upbringing. Both parents were employed and than it was necessary to help with housework, otherwise it would take too long. Fortunately, today there are dishwashers. I remember, the sink at our house was sometimes full. First the dishes from breakfast, than from dinner. And than the mother had to do them. My father never did the dishes, I have to say that. But my mother would always say: Clean up after yourself! And I was soon used to that. And now my wife says the same to my grandchildren. Clean up after yourself! And my children also say this to their children. It is not about cleaning up everything, but, I don’t know, to rinse a milk cup before putting it into the dishwasher. If it gets crusted the dishwasher won’t wash it properly. You have to at least rinse it. So the children now*| *|  but this is connected to the upbringing. Of course you can live without it. But now we are talking about very everyday things. (*| *| ) |*| 18 | R: Yes, mother. I am an only child. But in my family both children had to do it. One had to be asked more, the other less, but still. My mother*| *|  it was not like that, that I had to do it because being a male. If I had a sister, she would have to do it as well, probably.  |*| 20 | R: No. Sisters can resist. |*| 22 | R: No. Well, for example, my daughter knows how to use sewing machine. My wife knows how to use it, my son never learned. But the daughter knows how to sew, she learned. This is a difference. But it is again our logic. Some tasks are male – female. (*| *| ) |

In career. If we talk about medicine. If a woman was better, I found her better and perceived her as such. I never had a feeling to put some woman down because of my maleness or that some woman had advantages because of her femaleness. Nevertheless, there are tasks and jobs that I perceive as being more for men, as being more suitable for men. Let’s just say it like that. I still have difficulties getting used to male nurses. Because I grew up like that. In hospitals women were always besides the beds, men were doctors or were involved in physically demanding positions, at IR, they were more physical. Physiotherapists were men. I always think that a woman is more fragile physiologically. (*| *| ) |*| 3 | (*| *| ) |*| 4 | R: (*| *| ) Finally also men got I think three weeks of paternal leave. I don’t know, though, why they have it, unless his wife is so worn out from the labour that he must help her. Only in this case it makes sense to me. On the other hand, I had female colleagues, who started working very soon, and working night shifts. And now, of course*| *|  now we speak about night shifts. But there are certain tasks that are more likely to be assigned to men or women. But on intellectual level or when speaking about intellectual work, I think it doesn’t matter. The abilities matter. |*| 6 | R: It is hard to say, I don’t know such families and children, where a woman is ambitious and successful. Maybe those children have a positive role model in their mother and positive upbringing. Now we talk solely about women. Or maybe the upbringing is not good. And if a woman is lucky, some other person steps in, it can also be the father. Then a woman is superior to her husband, this is also a possibility, I know such cases. A husband takes over and it functions quite well. And there are also children that are totally loose. Children of high class citizens. I am not talking about simple people. But in such cases I think that the upbringing is not sufficient in the very basics. It is not due to the ambitious mother that works too much. Maybe they just don’t have a feeling for raising children or they work too much. (*| *| ) I always say how I imagine the family and also the tasks and jobs and careers. I would not mind a woman making a career and not staying at home. Because being a housewife is not much of a career. |*| 7 | (*| *| ) |*| 8 | R: (*| *| ) Female waiters are much appreciated. Or at least they were. I don’t know why. Firstly, they are cute; they are able to smile more than a man. There are just a few men that are able to smile and say something when needed. Male waiters are most likely to be dull. But women are at least able to smile. If they are not too tired. Now we talk about equalising male and female sex. At some cases it is not important; it is rather unimportant what you are. But there are jobs where the sex is important. Not the sex, but physical needs. Not mental abilities but it is better to be of more strength.  |*| 10 | R: Male nurses are much appreciated when a patient must be lifted. But when changing diapers and bandages and bathing I don’t know. If even they like to do that. I can see that the tasks are divided by themselves. But some women come and they already know which men are midwifes. There are some that are much appreciated. Midwifes.  |*| 12 | R: Some are. And it is known who they are. Maybe because they know how to smile or are more skilled. When talking about physical needs, there is nothing physically demanding at labour. So it is because they know how to behave, they provide a feeling of security. For a woman to have a man present, she has more courage. Even though traditionally midwifes were women. |*| 13 | (*| *| ) |*| 14 | R: (*| *| ) Women are becoming more self-consciousness, because they have more knowledge and are more daring to step into spheres which were forbidden for them in the past. At least there were some invisible line. And now they are stepping into these spheres and they are right. Some are also very successful. But still, they must breastfeed their children, this will not be changed. Some things are connected to the sex.  |

When I started thinking about this I realized that it is expected of us girls to help to clear the table and do things and the boys just sit down. |*| 2 |   |*| 3 | [...] |*| 5 | R: I don't think it happens in any other way than that we [the girls] rise and the boys don't. It's not  something we talk about, it just happens |*| 7 | R: Well... I guess it feels okay. And it doesn't happen so often since we don't meet so often. But I think  the way we look at this is a bit different between these three families... In my family, we are two sisters, so there hasn't been any [gender] difference, but it feels like as if there are different levels of awareness in the different families, and a difference as to how often things are discussed around the kitchen table |*| 9 | R: I think it depends on what you are used to... Well, you sense what you are expected to do, but you also do what you think is right. If you haven't felt that you should help doing things; if you aren't asked to, it doesn't come naturally, but if it's a part of a general feeling of ”this is what you do”, then you rise and do it... I think it is much like that, unconscious thoughts or feelings about what to do.  |*| 10 | [...] |*| 11 | R: And that is... if I think further, now that I start to talk about it, this does not only concern the younger generation, but also the parents. My relatives play golf but my father doesn't, so he's in the kitchen, helping out, but none of the men from the other families do that, because they are busy golfing or watching the TV. So, perhaps it is more natural that everyone helps in my family. |*| 12 | [...] |*| 14 | R: Perhaps not in this particular context, it's a bit sensitive... It's quite interesting, especially as my uncle has a hot temper - if something goes wrong, then... You hardly dare to cut the bread, because the slices could get a bit too thick [laughter]. My mother described this as a bit Nor*| é*| nian [Nor*| é*| n is a Swedish playwright who has done famous plays about family parties ending in disaster], and she has a point, it is very much that you can't do anything wrong, and everyone and everything amounts to not making certain people angry... So I think it would be hard to bring these things up in this particular context... But, if you are aware and see what happens you can make sure that these patterns don't form in other families or in other contexts, |*| 16 | R: No, I think that... In my family we discuss, we talk about these things and that's the normal thing to do for us. |*| 17 | [...] |*| 18 | R: (...) I was thinking about us being three very different families. In my family I feel that there is another kind of awareness, and my parents have the same level of education, while among the other parents', the man earns much more money and has a fancy job. That could also affect which role you take, I guess. |*| 19 | [...] |*| 21 | R: Yeah, that's right. |*| 23 | R: Exactly. The way she told it she had not really felt that it was any difference between men and women [while studying at the university], and when she started working it came as a huge chock... |*| 25 | R: Being a female doctor wasn't easy... The bosses very clearly diminished the women and were happy about the men... She started female doctors' networks and stuff...

I worked at a retirement home for elderly, as a summer substitute [*| 腣*| ] It was evening and we were two in the staff, and one of us was to handle the medicines, which is quite a lot of work. One of the residents, a woman in her 80'ies, was to have a shower, and the only person available to perform this shower was me.  |*| 2 | [*| 腣*| ]  |*| 3 | R: My colleague was female, and in the regular staff, and I was a summer substitute... And this elderly woman protested against me performing the shower, because I was a man. .. It took quite a long discussion with this woman for me to be able to perform this shower, I had to explain that I was there as a professional, to care for the residents and nothing else... The good part of this story is that, after the shower, the woman said this was the best shower she had gotten since she came to the retirement home.  |*| 4 | [*| 腣*| ]  |*| 6 | R: You take it very easy, and make sure the temperature of the water is good. All the time I informed her where I was going to wash her, and we had agreed before the shower, that she was going to tell me the moment it didn't feel okay. This was one of the conditions for me being allowed to shower her.  |*| 7 | [*| 腣*| ]  |*| 9 | R: I think she might have imagined that I would stare or even get sexually aroused or something. It doesn't work so many men at the retirement home. The men who work there have night duty, and you never shower during the night... |*| 10 | [...] |*| 11 | R: I guess she had never been showered by a man since she got there... And I also think that there are ideas in her generation, about women nursing and men being doctors. |*| 12 | [*| 腣*| ]  |*| 13 | R: (...) One of the men who lived there also had that idea, he asked me how it felt to do women's work. I was so shocked, I hardly knew what to say... I don't see it like that, I nurse, and I don't think only women can nurse... [...] That's something rather common when you work in the medical service. |*| 14 | [*| 腣*| ]  |*| 15 | R: Many people expect you to be or want to be a doctor... |*| 17 | R: Most people do it sceptically... They think you don't have the stamina to study to be a doctor or something... But when I say I want to work as a nurse, because I want to have close contact with the patients, something a doctor wouldn't have, many understand what I mean.  |*| 18 | [*| 腣*| ]  |*| 19 | R: I think it's mainly the male nurse students who get that question. I have female classmates who also get that question, but not as often as me or the other men. |*| 21 | R: More openly: Are you thinking about becoming a doctor later? To me they would say: I guess you are becoming a doctor later on? So he wording is very different. And this becomes very evident when you visit a patient with your class mate, because they ask both of us the same question, in a closed way to me, so that i shall answer: Yes of course I am going to be a doctor. It is posed more openly to the female class mate, so she can answer: No, I am going to be a nurse...  |

We have done most of the renovation ourselves, but everytime we have had a carpenter there it is [my wife] who asks most of the questions, and they answer to me...

You don't want the carpenter to go away and don't come back... But sometimes we have exaggerated it and planned that she shall ask the questions... And it doesn't help... Or, it might work once or twice, but mostly it doesn't |*| 11 | R: It's really quite tragic... But we know that this is how it is... Depending on what mood you're in, you get amused or frustrated. And, of course , it's worse for her, she is the one who isn't taken seriously... But I sometimes feel rather offended, because I also get pushed into a role that I don't... I don't like, I have never launched myself as a  carpenter type of guy... But I am forced to live up to that, and to act as if I knew what I was talking about. I think we [me and my wife] know equally little about carpentering, but some things she has looked into more than me, and then I can catch myself at playing along [with the carpenters expectations]   |*| 12 | [*| 腣*| ] |*| 13 | R: Yes, that [playing along] unfortunately comes easily if you're a man, to take chances, hoping no one will notice if you don't know what you're talking about.  |*| 14 | [*| 腣*| ]  |*| 15 | R: (...)

Because we have the same profession, we are both pastors, and we have worked at the same place, and have had the same boss. She had huge problems with him, or he had with her... Anyway, it didn't work out. And we have talked so much about this at home... This is so classically patriarchal, a textbook example...

This caused big problems when [my wife] started working there, at which time I had not had him as boss but already knew him...

And as there are a lot of women working there, I can see how he treats them... |*| 10 | [...] |*| 12 | [*| 腣*| ]  |*| 15 | R: Yes, but he can't  handle a woman who is as talented as he is, or has a bit better education than he has [which the wife has]... This is very evident to us, since we can compare our experiences of the same situation... |*| 16 | [*| 腣*| ]  |*| 18 | R: No, I think he wants women to work there, because that gives him an automatic authority.

And when I get there, it turns out that, well, for one thing, it was about 80 % men and 20 % women there, and the all of the women, except for me and my colleague, were young, cute, dressed-up, made-up girls who only served coffee, wrote protocols, booked the meetings of their bosses or male colleagues. When I came home I remember saying – they are nothing but boat-bunnies! And that gave me a chock, I didn't know it was that way... And in a concrete way it was hard, because many of the people I had meetings with were men. And many all the time asked if my male colleague was going to join us. We had decided to be in different meetings, to be as efficient as possible, and we also did different things [in the company]... The meetings without him, they weren't good meetings, there were no decisions made, we only talked. Because if a decision was to be made, the man in the meeting wanted to talk to [male colleague]...

I always said that if I could start life over and meet my husband*| *|  It wasn’t a good relationship and neither of us was happy, but if I were to start over, I would still marry him.  |*| 3 | R: Because I wouldn’t have the courage to search for someone better. (Husband’s name) was an extraordinary person from my point of view, a very 'comfortable person' for me. We weren’t happy, because we didn’t know how to be. When there is no communication*| *| *|  I couldn’t communicate with him at all.  |*| 5 | R: Because I was completely free, he never asked where I was going, when I return, why I left, no one made me accountable about doing the house chores, ironing, washing, cooking. I could have as well cooked and it was very good, but we could have also eaten nothing but bread for a whole week and nobody was asking why we were doing that. Or he never reproached me that he wanted the blue shirt instead of the white one, which I wasn’t in the mood to iron, for instance. And it was very comfortable. I didn’t really like doing house work, but I did, I had no choice, but I couldn’t say it was the passion of my life to cook and vacuum, but I did it out of conscience. And I figured I couldn’t live in a mess either, nor to let your husband out looking scruffy when everyone knows you, but for me it wasn’t like it was for my mother, she was passionate about taking care of my father, and of the house and wanted everything to be neat, it was the passion of her life, but not mine.  |*| 7 | R: Yes, and I generally cared for what everyone else around me thought and I once read that the more you care about the others’ opinion, the less chances are to reach your goals. And it proved to be right.  |*| 8 | (...) |*| 10 | (*| *| ) |*| 11 | R: (*| *| ) And then I went to America and I slaved for millionaires in America until I couldn’t do it anymore. (Husband’s name), may he rest in peace, was a really good man, but also very lazy. You know that during Ceausescu’s regime, or maybe you don’t know it that well, but it was hard to find anything and if you didn’t wait in lines or have connections so that queueing wouldn’t be necessary*| *|  And since I was never able to make connections I was waiting in lines and I asked (husband’s name) to wait in lines as well. I asked him to join me to Amzei market, since every Tuesday or so the chicken truck used to come. I was asking him to wait in line for I don’t know what because we had a child that had to be fed and he said “the child can eat nothing but bread for all I care, I won’t be waiting in line. I won’t do it, we can just eat bread.”   |*| 12 | (...) |*| 13 | R: No, I think that’s a matter of character and what one has seen in the family, but it’s not the case, although I keep seeing (Son’s name) playing with (Grandson’s name), he cuddles him, throws him up, goes on his hands and knees around the house, all sort of playful thinks. And I once told him that I can’t remember his father playing with him the way he plays with (Grandchild’s name). And he told me I had no idea how many times his father played with him and then I wonder where I was then. Because by the time he grew older – and indeed I went to America and stayed in the same house together, all the time*| *|  I can’t remember these things or maybe all that got stuck in my mind are those things about “if he doesn’t have any, then he won’t eat any, because I won’t wait in line, may he eat nothing but bread.” Maybe that’s not what he really believed; maybe it was his way of expressing discontent. I don’t know, but for me it had a great impact, what he said and I can still remember it and I will never forget it. Or when I used to tell him “let’s do something to make more money, because this child needs to learn a foreign language, he has to do some sport, he needs things and now, after the revolution everyone*| *| ” He went to school at Eminescu, along with all sort of snobs and I figured that maybe he wanted things too and wanted to offer him something. [and my husband used to say] “But did I have anything, or did you? Why does he have to have it? Why do I have to imitate X, Y, Z, and buy something just because they have it?” And then, that’s the reason why I went to America. It was an opportunity and everyone wants to see America and leave and do something to make things better.  |*| 14 | (*| *| ) |

I married right out of university studies, with a university colleague. And although my marriage was holding on with difficulty, because of infidelity issues, I tried to hang in there for as long as possible. I have been undergoing fertility treatments for ten years and still couldn’t... I had only, speaking of what is happening nowadays, I was in bed, without moving, for four pregnancies, trying to hold the baby and didn’t make it. After ten years, my marriage started to deteriorate also connected to the moment when it was obvious I couldn’t have babies, but there was also a slight tendency of my husband towards being unfaithful. There it is... I even experienced... for example I got a visit at the museum from the mother of a woman he was involved with. So there are moments which I am trying to tell and I told my younger colleagues so that they know that you have to expect anything in life. (...)  |*| 3 | (...) |*| 6 | R: It made a turn for the worse. Yeah, it regressed, I think. Because when I filed for divorce, in ’89, on grounds of infidelity – although he hadn’t cursed me, nor was he beating me... Speaking of violence, I had colleagues of various...even cleaning women...if they heard a woman was beaten up by her husband, you’d be summoned by the party, by the union and reprimanded. (...) Yeah, or if you got a divorce... I got a divorce, which was in no way encouraged, and the (museum) manager summoned me, manager who knew my husband well and he tried to convince me not to get a divorce, you know... And so I explained him the situation, (I told him) that it was pointless...that I had no kids – it was particularly difficult if you had kids (pauses) and the divorce took a long time. This was the law, you couldn’t. And the thing with domestic violence, we were always summoned, either by the union or by the party (...) Here in the museum we have a couple, a cleaning woman and a handyman and he’s beating her up so badly that he leaves her bruised and no one can stop him. I find it dramatic to not be able to defend oneself, but it is also linked to the fact that the Romanian woman still doesn’t... I am referring here to the average, because the intellectuals seem to have evolved a little, which might have resulted in an increase in the number of divorces. But divorces have other causes as well, so I am only referring to this aspect of unfaithfulness and lack of domestic peace. |*| 7 | (...) |*| 9 | R: If I felt pressure....No, I haven’t, because my husband was a very difficult person (...) the hardship came from the obligation to stay in the house. There was the problem of the house and then we ended up living together in separate rooms for many years. With him bringing various women in the house...a very difficult situation.  |*| 11 | R: It was on my name, and I gave it up like a sucker. |*| 13 | R: Through the workplace. This is how it was, you had to be listed. And in that order – I received it (the house) late, because as I didn’t have children, the couples with children had priority, depending on how many children they had. And only late, when everyone in the museum had a house, my turn came up. I really wanted to separate from my mother. He was coming home very late at night and so I had problems with my mother. My mother sensed it and I didn’t want her to know and I thought that if I moved out she would stop noticing.  |*| 15 | R: Yeah, through the museum. (...) In order for me to be granted the extra room I had to obtain a medical certificate and in the ‘80s, when an accident happened just next to me, a girl almost died, I had a panic attack and I suffered from a rather big depression for two years. (...) I was under treatment (...) They gave me this certificate stating I was entitled to an extra room. Because otherwise, without having children, you were not entitled to two rooms.  |*| 16 | (...) |*| 19 | (...) |*| 21 | R: No, that’s the point, there was nobody. When I was stuck on this idea...because I had too much evidence, you see and too much...no, it was unbearable, he went so far as to bring certain persons in the house...this is unthinkable. No, no one influenced me. If someone were to influence me, many would have told me to reconsider. |*| 23 | R: Back then it was perceived more dramatically than it is now, as far as I know. But as I don’t have children, I cannot say for sure. It would have been completely different, if I had children I might not have divorced. If I had children maybe he wouldn’t have cheated on me, who knows. I don’t know. Because he wanted children and now he has a small child, that woman gave him a child, you see? At 59 years old. This is how things turned out. |

I have been a museum curator, I am a museum curator, I have graduated from History in 1967 and since then I have been working for a period of 22 years at the Museum of History of the Romanian Communist Party of the Revolutionary and Democratic Movement as a museum curator, doing guiding and tour work and a series of exhibitions, some of which I joined abroad, especially in socialist countries. (she explains she is currently retired but still working at the museum on a contract basis). I stayed for so many years after my retirement age and I think they accepted it also because (pauses) I hanged on, I was always here. On the other hand, this experience of mine compensated in a way for my wage loss because now I have many extra work years and so it makes a difference.  |*| 2 | (...) |*| 3 | R: (...) But after the revolution, (name of female superior) opposed, and said that those (employers) from the Party Museum should start from entry level, so next thing you know, I started all over again as a junior curator, after 22 years. This affected me, considering I was divorced and single, it affected my wage a lot and even now is affecting my pension.  |*| 4 | (*| *| ) |*| 6 | R: If she had a job it was very difficult. I am telling you from the point of view of the woman who didn’t have children, if you didn’t have children it wasn’t so complicated and I tried to help my female colleagues a lot. Before the Revolution (the Romanian revolution which overthrew the communist regime in 1989) we were working Saturdays and Sundays and we were free on Mondays. You can realize how this was problematic to women with children. (*| *| *| ) But to me women, at least at official level, were more protected than in these day and age, somewhat more protected (she contrasts the time of the communist regime with the time of post-communism). Although when it was time to go to pickup corn at the institution, or to remove the snow, we would all go, from managers to women. |*| 7 | (*| *| ) |*| 9 | R: (...) The woman was - as was demanded from her to be - a mother, the accent was on being a mother. It’s only today that the accent is more on profession, a small change in accents, although even back then (under the communist regime) women wanted to see themselves professionally fulfilled as well. But back then there were more housewives. I look at my mother...well it was the ’50s...but my mother gave up work to raise us and it was just my father working. Now things have evolved. |*| 10 | (*| *| ) |*| 12 | R: He didn’t oppose it. We were both historians. No, no...I think back then women were encouraged to work, not to stay home. From what I know, from the environment I was in at least. They were all working, they all wanted – especially in this intellectual field – to do extra activities, to write, to do fieldwork. I even worked at provincial museums, at (name town), at (name town). I would stay there for a month and this was no issue. So back then women were working side by side with men. Now I cannot tell how things are in the museum. In any case, today, I make up my mind with difficulty to ask for help from a man, physical help, because we are working with and carrying objects. Before, someone would immediately jump to help you. Now they do it less often. But I hope the youth will shape up and return to that solidarity. |*| 13 | (...) |*| 14 | R: (...) I believe she-Ceausescu (Elena Ceausescu, wife of the head of state) anticipated what was already going on in the Western World: the independent woman. She wasn’t so much of an academic, she wasn’t so much of a scientist, but did she fight? Yes, she did! It was the issue of equality of women to men. That she should work, that she should be an academic, a professor, a good doctor, no? A good surgeon*| *|  (...) I believe she took inspiration from the West. But that doesn’t mean one should be a fake female scientist, like she was (...). |*| 15 | (*| *| ) |*| *| ? |*| 19 | R: No, I don’t think that, but we didn’t have the tradition for women to drink either. Look at it now, by doing ethnography, anthropology and sociology. We are rooted in a Romanian female peasant who was pretty austere and devoted to her husband [pause] you know? And this perpetuated to a great extent. But in my opinion emancipation started in the ‘70s. So then there was no more puzzle of how could a woman be single. Another example, we had here at the party museum, a colleague, so The Party Museum*| *| *|  I can still remember this. She met the man, he was 10 years younger (*| *| ). And, mind you, nothing happened to her at the museum; on the contrary, we were always taking care of her. So she had an illegitimate child. During Ceausescu’s regime it wasn’t*| *|  Today it’s common again. If you want to have a child, two women can raise it. A man can’t. (*| *| *|  I didn’t know I was having a miscarriage and when the doctor came by, he noticed that. But for children, I can understand anything. Because if there’s something I regret in life is that I didn’t have children, and nothing else. I didn’t just run idle either, all the time I was*| *|  that’s why I never had holidays. My mother is still reproaching me that*| *|  but practically my boss was taking holidays, she showed up for work at 1 p.m., or 2 p.m. and somebody had to be there, because we were at the public relations office. Mr (director’s name) came and started asking me to make phone calls, call people. An immigration writer came by and he sent me to him: “Give him an invitation! Ask him to stop by, because he’s a friend of mine from Paris, from Venice.” |

His sister was about 10, but knew thoroughly how it should be done. The gestures and positions were, as we realized later on, the correct ones and it was a ridiculous initiation manner, but it still counts as initiation.

They accepted to sleep with more boys in a row and that was called “The Post”. And the novice, the virgin, was the last to follow the older boys’ tracks, but seriously, it happened in the ‘60s and I think it was well represented. Now I haven’t heard of it.

Of course, it was the cheapest option, but I think the most important thing was that you’re led, you’re following the older one’s tracks, or the more experienced than you, if not the older.

My mother claims that my father, being an old fashion kind of man in what concerns raising the children and family roles, insisted that she stayed home. And the fact that she disagreed constituted the main reason for divorce. Indeed, my mother started working right after the divorce, against heavy odds. She wasn’t working in Bucharest, but in Apuseni Mountains, in places where it must have been very hard and uncomfortable for her to work [pause] especially as a single woman. And my father also became a mother to me, he started cooking for me, to do a lot of house chores by the time his last wife appeared, who raised me and stayed at home. She stayed at home*| *|  I think she hadn’t been working for a while and I guess she was used to being a housewife and there were hard times for us back then, because we lived out of only one wage. But at least everything related to household and my care and education was assured by mother’s constant presence. And okay, nowadays my wife reproaches me that, in her opinion – it’s not solely a reproach, but also a neutral observation, for that matter – she thinks that since the two children were born, she had to give up an intellectual career. She was working, but she had to give up an actual intellectual career. She’s a librarian and had to give up writing, research. These things could be perfectly true, because once the children grew older, she was to a great extent set free by responsibilities related to them and then she started translating; she’s doing a lot of translating and does so many things besides her career and therefore, she did wonders, also during our boy’s early childhood.  |*| 3 | R: I was six, I never learned about this story [pause] but it’s true, I was never extremely curious about it. I could have found out, I don’t know. Of course, my mother had to be blamed for something, to take responsibility; I don’t know exactly what happened then. I don’t know whether my mother left home, or something that she was supposed to be accused of what happened, something that fell within judiciary norms at that time. It’s unusual.  |*| *|   |*| 5 | R: Yes, it is unusual indeed, to be raised by the father. In the end, I was extremely satisfied, because my mother was far from having my father’s determined tenacity, she was rather straggling, light headed, and I would have probably been raised in a strange manner, or she would have taken me with her. I don’t know what she would have been supposed to do. Anyway, father was extremely constant and tenacious and I took all his trouble (?), but he insisted a lot, he certainly insisted a lot and mother was far less determined, he insisted a lot that he raised me so that he could make sure [pause] that I wouldn’t be left alone or with the cleaning ladies to see after me.  |*| 6 | (...) |*| 8 | R: She was an agronomist, an agronomist engineer, for all of her life and she had to endure a lot for this. Because when she was working in Bucharest on a*| *|  at Obor Market, where the cars with export fruits were brought, she was checking the exports and she had to stay in the cold, standing, often among coarse people, but she was managing it. And she inherited a part of her energy, which she certainly had, from her father, but she didn’t as well inherit his pragmatism regarding objective matters. She was some sort of a dreamer (*| *| ) |*| 9 | (...) |*| 10 | R: Later on, my mother fell in love with my first born child and she took care of him as she never took care of me.  |*| 11 | (respondent states that he was five when his parents divorced and he was put in his father’s care)  |*| 13 | R: I don’t remember it as being a manifest catastrophe, it probably meant something, I mean I withdrew after that, I never felt*| *|  I don’t remember ever feeling abandoned in any way*| *|  that’s exactly because my father’s presence was very acute. There were two old aristocrat women part of (name of old aristocrat family) family, which lived in*| *|  in a terrible misery. They lived a few houses away and they took care of me, they were paid for it, of course, and that improved their life quality as well. I can vaguely remember the meals my dad cooked, which I remember liking.  |*| 15 | R: Yes, of course, he was doing almost everything in our household before he remarried and his second wife*| *|  after he got back from work he was doing house chores.  |*| 16 | (*| *| ) |*| *|  when did she complete the family, were your father’s domestic roles completed by his new wife? |*| 18 | R: Yes, undoubtedly.  |*| 20 | R: Certainly, he constantly worked because otherwise we would have disappeared, since there was no other source of income aside from his wage.  |*| 22 | R: I don’t think it was dramatic for her, because I know she used to be a clerk at the Board of Trade for a while, during the inter-war years. For some time she had been a medium range clerk or even lower, it was well paid and she could have afforded a decent life, without any doubt. And then she was, I mean her first husband was [writer’s name], the writer, and I imagine he didn’t ask her to do a lot of chores, but anyway, she hadn’t been working at the time they lived together. She probably worked between marriages. (*| *| ) Anyway, it was the thing she accepted most easily. I don’t think she ever complained for being confined and*| *|  or deprived of a career, because there wasn’t even such thing as a career.  |*| 24 | R: In the ‘50s it was somewhat normal for the woman to be a housewife.  |*| 26 | R: Of course! That, indeed, but it was about much younger people. She wasn’t old when these things happened, but as they were both completely out of Communism, rather than*| *|  [pause] they were locked in by Communism to the extent that they lived within the Communist state. Otherwise, there was no relationship, no sympathy, on the contrary. I don’t think*| *|  and they weren’t responding to any kind of Communist propaganda.  |*| 27 | (...) |

She used to say: “You have nothing whatsoever to worry about. You’re the family’s intellectual and that’s also because of my sacrifice so then why aren’t you doing it brilliantly?” And I couldn’t stand this at all [laughs].  |*| 6 | R: No [laughs]. I was equally lazy, even after these reproaches. (...) I wasn’t thinking that I was supposed to brilliantly represent the family intellectually, as my wife certainly seen it, and she considered herself completely aggrieved and I knew this, as I always know that it wasn’t fair by no means. Not necessarily because my wife was intellectually gifted, no. It’s not fair from any point of view to let the other work incredibly hard and you to enjoy the privileges that you’re not even justifying. It’s like taking the privileges for granted an enjoy them.  |*| 8 | R: It happened in the ‘80s when she started learning German and this is how everything started changing, because she learned it so well that*| *|  she started translating and she translated extremely difficult pieces from German. She translated philosophy, religion and she translated Jung, she translated Heidegger’s Paideea, she translated Walter Benjamin. She translated so many things, many of them being extremely difficult. She translated Moshe Idel from English, Ioan Petru Culianu, that’s where we worked together at translating it in Italian, from Italian in Romanian. But she started massively translating for several publishing houses and she became a very competent translator. |*| 9 |   |*| 11 | R: This is what she had always waited for. She was waiting for the children to grow up so that she can be free; I mean she was certainly unhappy with her being just a librarian, every day. (...) She knew me well enough to know that I wasn’t quite capable of the greatest benevolence in the world; not that I wouldn’t have been able to have her achievements, which were really remarkable. They are remarkable even today. She always used to say that “I should get a man in the house”, because she is also the technician in the house [laughs]. I never doubted, she says I took advantage of this, but I never once doubted her intellect.  |*| 12 | (...) |*| 14 | R: No, they resorted to their mother, almost every time they went to their mother.  |*| 16 | R: They felt she was the firm ground one could safely walk on anytime they needed her. And even extremely late, after 30 years, they still tell her things that I suppose they should tell me, traditionally speaking. Everything, their love lives’ misfortunes, it’s her that she finds out, and not me. That means they trust her more than they trust me and nowadays and good for them [laughs].  |*| 18 | R: I can remember one of the situations. It wasn’t a recurrent situation. Once they whined about a dog who used to be the whole neighborhood’s terror and I left home armed and ferociously angry, which the poor dog was in the end spared of (*| *| 20 | R: I do, but I never taught them. Virtually, I agree that there should be an absolute equality between sexes, but in the same time I take advantage of the way how – due to tradition’s inertia which leads to separation of roles and definitely to an easier life for men, because men, not only from my generation, but also for the next generations, have it much easier. I mean they gain much more rights than women do. It’s not about the wages or intellectual abilities, but in another sense, in a sexual sense it’s definitely differently seen. Men are generally considered heroes when beside their wife they have one or more mistresses, while the woman is considered a whore [laughs]. I always said that I think I would be terribly miserable, I always told my wife, although it didn’t happen, that she could do the same thing and I wouldn’t mind. She could miss from home, as I used to and I would accept that, it’s her right, especially since I was doing it.  |*| 22 | R: No, and I don’t think she believed me either, but [pause] I hope I wouldn’t have reacted as other men. I mean, freedom has to be equal, for both spouses, although it obviously isn’t. (...) |

They should put it in a looser manner, provide a more general message, more universal, more unanimous. This emphasis on men’s day, on “if you drink beer, then you’re a real man” and so on, also comes out of convenience; to a certain extent it’s all because the opportunity to create Men’s Day came up. (laughs) Men’s Day was taken into consideration by (Razors manufacturing company), which was entirely for men and which indeed exists.  |*| 2 | (*| *| ) |*| 4 | R: (*| *| ) There are people who think of this kind of events and occasions as means to sell their products, promotions, concerts, and then as women’s day already existed*| *| 5 | (*| *| ) |*| 7 | R: Both in the case of current commercials and the ones from several years ago beer is listed somewhere among men’s features. So men are like this: they like football, laughing, making bad, pub-like jokes, they like sexy women, barbeques, they’re meat eaters, carnivores, between brackets, they are “hunters”. There’s also that they are not ecologists, at least last year there was an emphasis on this aspect. And among many others, there is also the beer. (*| *| ) And there are rough jokes, like hahaha, so not very delicate jokes. The best illustration is the one stating that after I don’t know how many beers all women seem beautiful and there are commercials staking on this type of humor. There’s a foreign ad stating that the more a man drinks, the more beautiful a woman seems to him; we (the Romanians) have the one for (Beer brand) of course with the man who wakes up in the morning, handcuffed to the bed and finds some incredible large women’s underwear in bed next to him, without being able to remember anything else from the previous night, but he’s stuck there, because he’s handcuffed.  |*| 8 | (*| *| ) |*| 9 | R: (*| *| 10 | (*| *| ) |*| 11 | R: For a little while I worked for (Razors manufacturing company) and indeed there was a lot of emphasis on football. I worked on detergents for a long time, various types of detergents that are targeted towards women. Women are housewives, studies have been carried out ever since the ‘90s which made it clear: housewives, soap operas watchers, frustrated; so the feminine target was pretty clear-cut and the prey was certain, I mean it was seriously taken into consideration by advertisements, especially for detergents.  |*| 13 | R: I don’t, because it was something polarized, I wasn’t saying: you’ll be happy using*| *|  I wasn’t making the agreement or declension, either of them. If it had to be about women, I was doing it about women, but it wasn’t acutely sexist. At the time I was working on detergents things weren’t so gendered, so strongly polarized as they are now.  |*| 14 | (*| *| ) |*| 16 | (*| *| ) |*| *|  |*| 19 | R: I can make more than one guesses. One of them refers to the fact that marketers and advertisers are feeling lazy and then they just look over these internal files and say – “it’s a commercial that targets men, there’s this commercial aimed at the target audience” - segmentation of target audience helps you avoid rambling and make a targeted commercial. It’s true that you make a commercial that should appeal to women as well, but if the main target comprises men, then you have to create the commercial for these men, it’s what in rhetoric is called ideal audience.  |*| 20 | (*| *| ) |*| 21 | R: You work around this profile, of individual who gathers and mediates many real peoples’ features and then ok, you do this thing, but no, they stop at this point: they’re men, they’re men, they’re men, I have to tell they’re men.  |*| 22 | (*| *| ) |*| 25 | (*| *| ) |*| 27 | R: To the ones who have bigger masculinity issues, the very young ones and the elder ones I guess, but since the older ones are not interested in advertising other than the one about prostate... (...) they target the young.  |*| 28 | (*| *| ) |*| 30 | R: No, right now we’re at a point where there’s nothing new coming up. We’ve seen it all in the ‘90s, up until 2002-2004. Now all we do is re-stage some old ideas. Even more so, we tend to draw back and release very cautious messages, which in advertising are called content, meaning themes. There’s nothing new in this sense. There could be something new in what concerns using communication media, the way internet or Facebook or such could be embedded. Facebook is mostly feminine; women are more active on these communication media. Maybe to some extent, this impacts the message and contents. Also there are the glossy magazines: there’s been an attempt to follow the relatively successful model of glossy women’s magazines, to sell, to launch on the market some glossy men’s magazines. (*| *| ) And at this point these things are somewhat experimental in Romania, because women read more than men. Also, here’s why the answer for “why aren’t men reading men’s magazines” is a particularization of the question “why aren’t men reading?” – it’s because they like watching TV better, they don’t read much, I mean they don’t read as much as women do, they don’t have the same amount of patience, the same interest. |*| 31 | (...) |

I mean a simple device in comparison to what it exists now, which is used for diabetes, one stage before insulin treatment. Before the beginning of that stage when the one with diabetes is insulin-dependent, there is a less severe stage when you have to take certain medication. It will be released, it’s about to be released, this device that is relatively simple, but for the ones who see it for the first time it involves a certain degree of complexity, if not difficulty – in what concerns handling it, understanding how it works. And she noticed this aspect, in Germany, during the presentation, that all of the people gathered there, people working in marketing, PR, communication, were split in two broad segments, regarding the way they managed to understand the device and how they were handling it: men and women (laughs). Men managed to figure it out in a relatively short time, they managed to open it – especially since, for safety reasons, it doesn’t open very easily, it has certain hidden spots that make it somewhat hermetic and safe, but it’s marked, it has little arrows, it’s made so that you can figure it out in the end. Men catch on almost instantly and they aren’t among those who’ve been in the army and got to open the machine gun. It lasts 30 seconds, and even less to assemble it back. Men just make it in a relatively simple manner, statistically speaking. I don’t know, maybe there are men who need more time to figure it out. And women*| *|  it’s disastrous, women catch on with much difficulty. And she noticed that barrier or maybe the Germans also told her – \""look we have some trouble with this thing, which we didn’t expect. Although we’ve made it very friendly, it appears that women\""*| *|  maybe they’re more non-technical, I mean, it wasn’t a misconception. No one said: hey, these women are stupid. God forbid! And, how should I put it*| *|  empirically, they realized this after they noticed that the women take very long to work through it. I mean, if you can see someone else doing it, it’s easy, but when you see it for the first time*| *|  And she did this experiment, and it went on at the office and at home as well. (*| *| 2 | (*| *| ) |*| 4 | R: It depends on the disease, I don’t know. On the other hand, women pay more attention to their health, they’re more careful, they take more care of themselves and are more attentive, they ponder more often about their physical problems, which could be funny for men, but it’s also a good thing.

And he can do sports, but he should withhold from effort. When he was little I assigned him for dancing lessons because realistically speaking he wasn’t able to do sports like basketball, football or karate, which are in fashion now. He wasn’t able to pass the training stage. I observed several training sessions with children, which are very important; the ones who practice sports know that it’s not about playing ball, there’s a pretty rough training involved.  |*| 4 | (*| *| ) |*| 5 | R: Yes, and I realized that he couldn’t make it to shooting the hoops or other things like this which would constitute the fun part. And then I assigned him to dance lessons, where he was pretty clumsy, he didn’t have the girls’ gracefulness.(*| *| ) And on the other hand it was good, because since there were so few boys that the instructors said “how good that we have boys now so that we can organize the kids in mixed-gender pairs.”(*| *| ) And we assigned him to swimming lessons, which are unisex (laughs). I sent him to take piano lessons because he likes music and we wanted him to develop his handiness.

We want them to be happy and healthy. We don’t necessarily want them to win medals, to make fortune or things like that.

I had certain technical problems in high school especially when it came to Chemistry and I gave up the idea of Pharmacy or Med School also because a doctor’s income is extremely small nowadays. So I chose this (Sociology, with a minor in Human Resources), because I figured it is a relatively new discipline and I have more chances of getting a job.

During gymnasium, I was somewhat good at Romanian Language and humanities, meaning the ones more appropriate to women. However the closest I was to going to high school I was – not necessarily convinced, but more and more aware that my place would rather be in a natural science class. This is because I became aware and I bore my role within society. As I said before, social sciences were, by default, for women and it was a typically feminine field. I don’t know if it was necessarily a conscious choice, but it mattered a lot to my specialization choice in school.  |*| 2 | (...) |*| 3 | R: The classes which rather belonged to humanities were Romanian Language and Literature, where in my experience girls were considered more creative by default. Our professors didn’t explicitly say it, but it was obvious by the number of answers given. If you came in our class for instance, you would have seen much more girls answering, rather than boys. And girls did their homework much more often than boys did. From this point of view, I think that it’s not necessarily about an attraction (towards humanities), but they were also considered more hardworking and since they were considered more hardworking, better prepared, this stereotype had an impact on them as well and that’s probably why they were performing better than we were. I remember this also because we (boys) used to cheat at tests looking at their papers, copying from them, things like these.  |*| 4 | R:(*| *| ) especially fields involving creativity, a certain capacity to empathize were dedicated exclusively to girls.  |*| 5 | R:(*| *| ) I don’t think that our teachers guided us towards a certain direction, I mean they did discriminate – “look, you’re less creative than someone else” – and so on, but I think it was also something previously induced, during childhood, that creativity is for more empathetic persons, and who else was more emphatic than the mother or the women in your life? (*| *| ) (Girls) are always taught that their turn will come to be a mother, a wife, to take care of everyone important in their life and then they will implicitly learn how to be more empathetic. Exactly because they always have to take care of someone, that women are expected to take care of the ones around them, that’s what makes them more empathetic, more open towards the others’ needs, while men are taught that they have to provide money for the family, to support the family. Of course, it’s no longer the case, but anyway, even nowadays there are differences. (Men) have to always sublimate their feelings, to look impenetrable towards everything around them.  |*| 6 | (*| *| ) |*| 7 | R:(*| *| ) it is expected for boys to learn less and for girls to be more hardworking, more assertive in what concerns getting a job in this kind of activity. I don’t know why, I never actually got this stereotype, but that’s pretty much how it is.  |*| 8 | (*| *| ) |*| 9 | R: Yes, and during childhood, when we were playing football, or riding a bike and fell, and one of us hurt himself, they were looked at in disapproval if they started crying, screaming, while for women this was allowed. It wasn’t allowed for us, that’s how it’s like, I mean starting from childhood you were taught to sublimate your feelings, to show contempt towards pain, while in the case of women, they were actually encouraged to express their feelings as openly as possible.  |*| 11 | R: Yes, because interpreting a literary text involves, in my point of view, having a certain connection, a certain emotional background to relate to. Without this emotional background, you can’t interpret the literary text. |*| 13 | R: Yes, in the case of girls, romance novels are popular, indeed more than in the case of boys who are more oriented towards more practical readings.  |*| 14 | (...) |*| 15 | R: (...) In my 8th grade I had pretty good grades, so I could choose almost any high school I wanted in my hometown. Therefore, I wanted to make a compromise, the natural sciences compromise, which was part of the science field. It was a compromise between the real science class – Mathematics-Informatics - and Philology or Social Sciences where I wanted to go. I particularly liked History, not so much Romanian Literature. And it was some sort of compromise after long debates with my family, after I realized it might be much easier to find a job if I went to a science class rather than a humanities one, and so on. That was about it, so it was some sort of compromise. Natural Sciences are somewhere in the middle – between science in its pure form and Philology. (...) Hard sciences offered me more opportunities, so I was set to follow that path. As I mentioned before, I believe it has to do with gender. |*| 16 | (...) |*| 18 | R: I don’t know, I think it would have been an awkward situation. I think I would have felt assimilated, deprived from what defined me as a man. Because being a man is an important part of my identity and being assimilated would have been a pretty shameful matter.  |*| 20 | R: Exactly, that’s right.  |*| 21 | (...) |*| 22 | R: (*| *| 24 | R: Yes, right, regarding their behavior, there were much less tough, more emasculated, more... I don’t know how.  |*| 25 | (...) |*| 26 | R: It wasn’t like in Philology, where there were 2-3 (boys) in 20 something students and indeed, all along high school we kept a certain amount of individuality. I mean it was obvious which the boys were and which the girls.  |*| 27 | (...) |*| 29 | R: Yes, for instance, only boys were taking part in sports. For example, playing football, basketball, same as skipping classes – boys were skipping classes more than girls. |*| 30 | (...) |*| 31 | R: No, we never formed mixed teams; maybe once at basketball. So I remember that once, at basketball we made teams together with girls*| *|  and I think it was also for handball, where there were mixed teams. And boys were really hitting hard, while girls couldn't hit that tough, so you couldn’t ask them to sit in defense and other things for these games. But at football, never. Football was always exclusively for boys. |

(*| *| ) He was one year younger, he had no experience, we had applied some questionnaires before, it was our first time in a non-urban area and I believe this particular questionnaire referred to income, I think, so some pretty insidious questions, which people couldn’t answer easily, including some on political orientation. What I noticed was that in the moment when we went and tried to explain to them, and state our status, that I was a student and we were doing a research on this, this and this, when we would get to the political questions we would inevitably arrive to things such as (*| *| ) “what do girls have to do with politics”, (*| *| ) “why do you want to know” and we would end up with nothing, after hours and hours of trying, inquiring, talking to women who were telling me to wait for their husbands to come home, so they could answer the questions about politics claiming they didn’t know these things, “my husband knows, but he is away now”. Women knew the following things: family members, income and such. |*| 2 | (...) |*| 3 | R: There was a rainfall, it was very cold and we wanted to go inside somewhere in (name village), in this dirt hole, we just wanted to enter into a bar, which was populated with males and we were met with a general “Ooooh, women!” (*| *| ) So we couldn’t enter and we stayed outside and got soaked, it was lovely (ironical tone). So this boy was always returning full of smiles and with his bag full of questionnaires, so we became curious, “man, how does he do it, what is this result, is he smiling more?” (*| *| ) This guy was pretty welcomed by the community, he was chatting with people much easier than us, and maybe we also seemed too*| *| maybe we were dressed wrongly! (laughs) |*| 4 | (...) |*| 5 | R: (...) This guy could speak heart-to-heart, especially with the male population, I mean it seemed to include a sort of man-to-man admiration, “being a countryside man, I am not very knowledgeable, but you str young so you can ask me some questions”. It seemed that even the honesty level of the respondents was adapted a little and it seems to be this man-to-man thing, like “you know how things are, don’t you”, with income, with your woman, with this and that*| *| men who discuss politics and do politics. I was frustrated for not being able to look different in order to get more questionnaires, but I think there was this imposed distance, at least, on one hand, towards those who do the interview, and towards how you approached it. I mean most of the women could answer questions related to income, somehow, probably it was them who managed a part of the money, they had access to this. But regarding the part on Securitate, Securitate files, political options, they would always send you to the family man or the man who was available in that household, if any. “I will go ask my son, my man, my father-in-law”, they would always send you to a masculine figure who was supposed to be in charge of this, under the pretext that “they know these things, not us”. |*| 7 | R: I think there was a strategy through which, as far as I remember, we avoided starting with those questions, so that we wouldn’t put them off, we’d start with the questions that seemed more their field, so they wouldn’t be inhibited completely, those on income, on family members. (*| *| ) |*| 9 | R: Yeah, the women’s option seemed to conform to the man’s decision.  |*| 10 | (...) |*| 11 | R: (*| *| ) there was also this thing, that many times - this was happening 3-4 years ago, I think – this idea of women in politics didn’t penetrate the rural areas, wasn’t known. Even if the implicit assumption about women in politics is that “who knows who they slept with to get there”, I believe that now things have changed for the better. But I still notice this similar thing to that fieldwork research of ours. When I was with a male friend in the bus, discussing politics, something, I don’t know, some piece of news, we were commenting on it. And an older guy on the bus told him in awe that “you will become a great man!”. And it was as if the hope in the new generation and politics needs to be supported by guys, maybe also in this context that “the youth is emigrating and we need someone to stay here and take care of things”. And I believe this is rather oriented towards the male population, that you need a man with a good image, who is still a bit paternalistic, with an iron hand.  |

There is also the preconception that men don’t gossip. (laughs) To me it seems that it’s worse, or just as bad.

I mean if you are unprofessional as a woman, it can only be because of a failure in your personal life, that’s it.  |*| 18 | (...) |*| 19 | R: It is a pattern I heard numerous times.

I mean everything seemed to work just fine, I had graduated from university, I had won a scholarship in Budapest, I mean... everything was just fine and I still...there was a dissatisfaction and I couldn't identify the source. Somehow I managed to realize that it was the dissatisfaction with a model that wasn't really mine, that had been imposed on me in a way. (...) Somehow my grandparents led me to believe that his (the brother's) behaviour was connected to the fact that he was raised by our parents who didn't know how to educate him properly (...) |*| 6 | R: (...) the problems in my family were that my grandmother was, for a long time, until recently, the governing personality, so there was a sort of matriarchy in our home where my grandmother was governing, really coordinating the whole family, because my parents had bought an appartment, rather my grandmother had arranged to find an appartment very close to her, two buildings away, and she was keeping everything under control. She was organizing these things, which child lives where, (...) So my brother had been rejected by my grandmother, do you understand? I was*| *| The chosen one”. But only later I did realise that my real feeling was one of abandonment, (...) that I had been abandoned by my parents but I managed to sublimate this feeling of abandonment into a fake feeling of being chosen, of being special, of having been chosen. And one of the reasons was this, that I was a girl, I mean I was always being told that they have always had girls and so for me this was a quality, I was a girl, it was ok. I had long hair... my grandmother kept my hair long down to my bottom until I was twelve. This was another discussion with the whole family, about whether I could cut my hair a bit.  (...) Of course my grandmother opposed and finally they convinced her, but I could only cut my hair a bit, not something revolutionary, just not to have it long down to my waist.  |*| 7 | (...) |*| 8 | R: I was sure that he (my brother) wished to be in my shoes. |*| 9 | (...) |*| 11 | (...) |*| 13 | (...) |*| *| 15 | (...) |*| 16 | R: (...) What I would like to take after my grandmother is her independence, let's say, her capacity to get things done without the help of others. She is exaggerating though and because of this she has the tendency to be overcontrolling and I don't like that. Somehow this is a challenge to me, because I also have this tendency to control what is happening around me, to try to have at least some control over the situations.  |

This is... this seems defining. It's the moment when you experience your womanhood at its fullest. It is something no man can do (...) On the other hand, beyond this widely accepted reality, the masculine side, to say so, is trying to take control over many fields that I believe should stay feminine. The way in which pregnancy is being integrated in the medical system in Romania and the way in which all you know or are allowed to know about what is happening with your body during the pregnancy is generally transmitted by a man in a white coat who is watching a screen... And he is the one telling you what is happening to you and what you are or aren't allowed to do and how everything is supposed to happen, culminating with the birthgiving... |*| 4 | R: This doctor whom I chose was the doctor where I went before I was pregnant and somehow it wasn't a choice. He was a person that with whom I thought to get along well. But note that until then I had only been to see him for gynecological matters... Concerning the pregnancy, I realize now that it is different and that there are countries where women don't go to see a gynecologist for pregnancy and birth. There are midwives... I mean... here (in Romania) these are put together under the same field (...) I don't think a doctor should be responsible over these things. I really believe that the system with midwives would function better here. Also because they are women. And I think this is one of the moments when gender plays a very important part. (...) I realized this with my second baby, when I changed the gynecologist without having had a clear problem...without necessarily wanting to change the gynecologist. I simply felt that I wanted to give birth with a woman on my side. (...) I felt more confortable this way. (...) |*| 5 | (...) |*| *| Your tolerance to pain is equal to zero”. (...) who invents these scales, who is to measure how well you can cope? (...) This is what is being discussed in birthrooms: who gave birth better, who didn't scream or who gave birth better and didn't disturb the nurses.  |*| 8 | (...) |*| 9 | R: The greatest frustration was that I felt I wasn't allowed to give birth. That I was deprived of the control over myself and my body (...) From the moment I entered the hospital door I was told to lie down on the bed, my underwear was pulled down, I was given some shots... from that moment I wasn't allowed to leave the delivery room, I had to stay in the position they indicated, I was given several shots, check-ups every hour, climb on the chair... I didn't do anything, I just had to deal with the pain, as quietly as possible... It's a known fact that birth is an active process. I mean it is the woman giving birth, she is not supposed to be given birth to. But in our maternity hospitals it is the doctor giving birth (...) In Romania you are giving birth with doctor what's-his-name. He is giving birth, he is giving birth to (name of respondent). I mean the verb*| *| 10 | (*| *| ) |*| 11 | R: I definitely wasn't given this opportunity. (*| *| ) If you tried to get up, the nurse would come and tell you to stay in bed. That was the rule: “You are not allowed, you have to stay in bed until we tell you to get up and to go deliver!”. |*| 13 | R: Unfortunately no, and that's what made it rather traumatic. (...) I remember my solution then was to behave. I entered this really submissive mode of behaviour. (...) I thought that if I behaved nicely and said*| *| pretty please” even for a glass of water, then they won't torture me too badly.  |*| 14 | (...) |*| 15 | R: I had been there for hours and he (my husband) didn't know what was happening to me, no one was telling him anything. (...) I only saw (name husband) after I had given birth, when they took me out on the corridor, where they had improvised a post-delivery room.(...) I saw the baby again only 12 hours after I had given birth to him. (...) you could only enter at six, when it was feeding time.  |*| 16 | (...) |*| 17 | R: A friend was telling me that yeah, it's true that they (the nurses) say a load of idiotic things, like*| *| Oh how you keep screaming” or*| *| Didn't you scream when you conceived him as well?” These things are really being told, the nurses are something else... |*| 18 | (*| *| ) |*| 22 | R: Yeah, they consult you too. Interaction is much said, they just look between your legs, i'm not sure this qualifies as interaction.  |*| 24 | R: No, not even close. You are just lying there on the table and the doctor checks you between your legs and takes a decision.  |*| 25 | (...) |*| 28 |   |*| 29 | (...) |*| 31 | R: No, I think it was exactly the same. I mean, judging by what my mother and grandmother had told me, not much has changed in our medical system. Maybe in a way I was disadvantaged because by having access to so much information and by knowing all the possibilities, how birthgiving occurs in other countries... The Netherlands, USA...I read loads about what systems are available in other countries. I believe my knowing how it could have been only increased my frustration. |*| 33 | R: Yeah, I was really expecting to be able to give birth myself, to go to the hospital and just give birth myself. Whereas my mother knew perfectly well that she would leave my father at the hospital gate and that someone would call him from the hospital to inform him that she had given birth. At no moment did she consider that he could come with her or that he could help her in any way. The delivery was clear upon arrival: we take the woman now, we take the baby out of her and we hand her over to you in three days.  |*| 35 | R: Yes, definitely. Or rather to the doctor to be more precise. |

I know that I was supposed to be his best man and I guess I was, but no one in our group had a clear idea about etiquette or about what should be done at a wedding of this kind. (...) And at one point, his (the groom’s) best friend suggested that we kidnap him, because this is always done with the bride and as it hadn’t happened until midnight or so we were all...we were four of five guys I think... We suggested this to (groom’ name) and he said*| *| Ok, why not?! Let’s do it!”. |*| 3 | R: I don’t remember exactly, but I know the bride was kidnapped at the same time. (...) We suggested that we go bowling or something. And I suggested or asked whether he had a bachelors’ party and that’s where it started, he said*| *| No, you were supposed to organize it!” and so I said*| *| Let’s do it now!” (...). I don’t even know what it presupposes apart from what you see in the movies: striptease or an awful drinking spree or whatever. We also had some group history with that, we had visited The Green House before, which was a sort of brothel in town. (...)  |*| 4 | R: (...) I know that all this time he was getting phone calls to pay the ransom to get his bride back, but he was claiming he was busy with something. I think her (the bride’s) parents were upset because he was missing as well instead of going to get his bride and that instead they were both missing from their wedding. |*| 5 | (...) |*| 6 | R: (...) So we found two prostitutes, well whores actually, because prostitutes sounds like out of pre-`89 Romanian movies, and we went to his (the groom’s) home, he was still living with his parents at the time. It was still in his bachelor room. And although all of us were very happy to do this and it was very sexy and of course we had been drinking, in the moment when each of us was supposed to choose a girl and to go in one of the rooms, no one wanted to do it. One said that he had brought his girlfriend to the wedding, another said*| *| *| Hey, you can’t expect me to do it. I paid for it, but I won’t do it on my wedding night!”. He had paid, because it was something the groom is supposed to do. And we ended up in this strange situation where the girls were insisting that we should go ahead and do the thing, since we had paid. I finally went with one (to have sex), came back and found a movie-like scene where one of the girls was alone, one of the guys was playing Solitaire on the computer, the other was flipping through some magazines, another was smoking and the other chick was very irritated. So I came back with the other girl and she said*| *| Hey, we still have half an hour left. Come on!” and the guys said*| *| No, it’s fine, let’s leave and just return to the wedding”. And the other girl was insisting too*| *| Don’t you at least want a blowjob?”. So it was this utter reversal of demand and offer! Meanwhile, the bride was phoning (...). So we took the girls back, in some sleazy area of the city. |*| 7 | (...) |*| 8 | R: At the wedding, there was just the bride, stolen and without her ransom paid and slightly irritated.  |*| 9 | (...) |*| 10 | R: Afterwards I bragged to people about stealing the groom instead of the bride and they said it’s been done before. So it wasn’t such a big deal. Back then I thought it was so cool to steal the groom, now it doesn’t seem that special anymore. |*| 11 | (...) |*| 12 | R: (...) So we told them (the prostitutes) we were coming from a wedding and they realised he was the groom, so they accepted more easily that he wouldn’t sleep with them.(...) They were very straightforward: \""Come on already!\"" Because they were rejected, they (the prostitutes) got upset and threatened to call the pimp. Indeed, it was completely unnatural that no-one was doing anything to them. I remember they called them impotents...I remember they phoned their guy, their pimp. (...) In the end they let us drive them back, they became more reasonable because, after all, they had been paid. |*| 13 | (...) |*| 15 | R. I don’t know, probably when she learned that he (the groom) couldn’t come for her as he had been kidnapped himself, she gave up waiting. She was probably stolen by a brother or by a cousin whom she could manipulate a bit. Generally they are more unmerciful, I mean they won’t return the bride until they get their exact alcohol demands or money or I don’t know what, but in that case she came back by herself.  |*| 16 | (*| *| ) |*| 17 | R: I know the groom was upset with the other guys for simply refusing to go all the way for him, since he had sort of sacrificed a pretty important situation in the long run just for their sake. So the fact that it wasn’t consummated was pretty disappointing for him. For me it was ok, as I went ahead with it, but his friends who were all from (name city) and had stayed in (name city), yeah*| *|  I mean I remember when I came back to the room he was snapping at them, saying “What’s up with you guys? We left the place, I paid and you’re just sitting here like idiots?”. He was pretty irritated and even now when we talk about it I can sense a frustration from his part.    |*| 18 | (...) |*| 20 | R. Yeah, we entered a scenario where we were supposed to satisfy one another and (...) for the sake of the scenario we went up to a point, because no one actually felt they should do this. (...) for some people that grew up together and did their teenage stuff together, a situation of this kind, a test...or not a test but rather you move forward by doing stuff together. (...) I was sort of the catalyst who turned the situation in a certain direction. I mean yeah, I probably helped make things more interesting. I mean I know I was the one who suggested it, (...) but what happened afterwards was the ending that they offered to me and it was pretty cool. I mean it was incredible. |*| 21 | (...) |*| 22 | R: I think that the fact that they (the prostitutes) felt offended that they hadn’t been used for what they know to do best proves a sort of resignation with or rather not a disagreement with the type of lives they leed. |"

We sat and talked a whole lot and even until today he remained the absolutely only guy in my life with whom I could talk for ten hours non-stop, we had moments like this. Afterwards I realized that it was something almost like a homosexual relationship, only without a consumation. (...) I don’t think he ever considered it. But as a typology, it was like being in a  relationship, because we would meet at highschool, we would call one another when we got home, we would spend so much time together. I remember that when he met other guys I was jealous. I mean... and at one point, he was a suffocating person and I couldn’t stay under his influence anymore, I tried to rebel...I stopped seeing him as often. He was really irritated and he stopped speaking to me for good. Somehow, even this reaction of his was the same type of feeling, a sort of affectivity.  |*| 4 | (...) |*| 5 | R: (...) I don’t think I was the only one for him, I mean there was a period when the two of us were very close, just the two of us. But he still had... He had a big group of friends where he was a sort of preacher.  |*| 7 | R: Oh, we were at a girls’ highschool. So this was somehow replaced by a mass of girls.

(...) |*| 11 | R: (...) He spoke a lot about girls. |*| 13 | R: I don’t remember if it was his influence but during that time I was trying to be myself. I had that type of teenage when I would make my girl-colleagues to call me Lucifer as a joke. I mean, as a guy, I had long hair, I was pretty enough. There were very few boys in that highschool and we were very much pampered by the girls. But at the same time I was very shy and I couldn’t express my affection towards a girl in any way. And my Cioran readings....I mean I would remember from Cioran (Romanian philosopher) only those negative quotes about women with the sexual act as coupling of limbs accompanied by idiotic noises or something like that...That the feminine voice is the greatest dissonance and the such. And I sort of had a depreciating attitude towards women, girls, female-colleagues. |

And after having access to the evaluation grid of all students of that class, he was able to see that his mark didn’t match the same patterns than the other girls who had better marks. In my class, now the class is not the same, there were many intelligent girls, it’s true, and others, it isn’t like they aren’t intelligent, right? But, clearly, they didn’t deserve a so good mark. Specially bearing in mind what you saw in classes. |*| 4 | (*| *| ) |*| 6 | R: (*| *| ) there were other girls to whom the professor sometimes smiled in classes, he used some gestures like someone who adverts and warns to stop, if not they will be punished with a little slap (laughs)*| *|  I don’t know how to say it, but*| *|  these were situations that bothered me and there was too much familiarity between the professor and these female students, something that didn’t happen with the boys (*| *| ) |*| 7 | (*| *| ) |*| 8 | R: (*| *| ) perhaps I also got the illusion that this is normal*| *|  but, normally, male professors get along with females students and female professors get along with male students, I don’t know*| *|  sometimes it has to do with people’s own personality. |*| 10 | R: To be sincere, sometimes it has to do with*| *|  well, not that sexuality and sexes interaction have importance here, but I think that it’s the natural order of things that maybe male professors like to interact more with female students, it’s true that with less 40 years than them, and we also know those examples and that the expression of “getting the degree in the horizontal” is very common (this expression means that students get better marks or pass the exams if they have sexual relations with the professors). (*| *| ) It seems to me that*| *|  not that I know any female professor that treats men in a different way than girls (*| *| ). |*| 11 | (*| *| ) |*| 13 | R: I don’t know many other university professors from other universities, but I wouldn’t be surprised if this happens, because unfortunately we have good and bad professionals. Now we are talking of university professors but we could also be talking about other things, like teachers in secondary level or even sooner, but that it’s a little bit more serious. We could also be talking about enterprises, with a male boss and a female co-worker*| *|  some other thing*| *|  I don’t get surprised, I don’t know many more examples, but I wouldn’t be surprised if this happens. |*| 15 | R: Yes, yes, yes. That’s why before I told you about of that story of “getting the degree in the horizontal”, right? It’s an expression that you hear and I believe there must be a reason why it exists. But I can’t tell you about of any example in concrete, nevertheless, of course, we hear about those stories from a friend of a friend that knows a person that was favoured in the grounds of its gender. (*| *| 16 | (*| *| ) |*| 17 | R: (*| *| ) the fact that this girl has been favoured, I think that is a little bit unfair and, in a class context, and the fact that it was in front of everyone in the class, it’s a little bit more flagrant, but I also wouldn’t be surprised if this happens many times without people noticing it. So, maybe in an enterprise context, between a male boss and a female co-worker or a subordinated female person, maybe these things are not so obvious, but I wouldn’t be surprised that they happen. But the most concerning thing, of course this is also concerning, but what is even more concerning is to have other kind of favouring, like money favouring or someone who apparently has merit and grew up in the career because of this kind of favouring just because she is a woman. But sometimes it hasn’t to do only with this. Sometimes it hasn’t to do just with disfavouring. Inequality between men and women also relies on the physical aspect, in the physical ability and since pre-history there was always this difference: women taking care of children and home, and men working, being the support, the breadwinner. This is a reality very present in many places. |*| 18 | (*| *| ) |*| 19 | R: (*| *| ) of course there always has been physical limitations between men and women, but what history has also showed us is that women, in the time they entered the labour market, they proved they are competent, they proved that, sometimes, are more competent than many men, and they proved that there must be equal opportunities for men and women. But there are limitations, in certain occupations, certain jobs; I think that there shouldn’t be any constraint to a woman to work in a civil constructor, but she won’t have the same performance, in the tasks that are more physical, as a man, only if she is into bodybuilding. (*| *| ) |*| 21 | R: Yes, I think so. I think so. They will have a weaker performance because the human body has its limitations and has it differences. A woman and a man, usually, a man has more strength, isn’t it? He has more, more strength*| *|  it doesn’t mean that he has more concentration or more insight*| *|  Well, it has to do, exactly, with professions and its tasks. |*| 22 | (*| *| ) |*| 24 | R: Because there wasn’t a principle of equality, right? If women fought for decades and decades to have the same rights than men, we can’t see the opposite, right? We can’t see women being favoured and men disfavoured in the grounds of its sex, and we can’t see a preference of one person that has power above other people. |

But, for me, I don’t think that is important; it’s important to understand that being the 2 of them the contribution parts of the family’s money, I think that both must have an equal opinion, an equal weight in the most important decisions in what financial family issues are concerned. |

(*| *| ) For example, there are certain activities, physical activities like*| *|  canoeing and*| *|  raid competitions that we do on scouts that not only boys do it, but also girls. And that proves that girls also*| *|  they also have the ability to participate.  |*| 8 | (*| *| ) |*| 10 | R: No. By the way, one of scouts’ ideals*| *|  well, I attend to catholic scouts, I can’t talk about other movements related to scouts, but the thing is to not have that sex discrimination in the tasks. This happens naturally. We get to the situations and this happens almost by intuition. But no*| *|  the chiefs’ scouts don’t divide girls for one side and boys to other to do different tasks. We organize like that by natural intuition. |*| 11 | (*| *| ) |*| 13 | R: (*| *| ) when there is this division, boys usually stay in charge of picking wood to the fire, of cutting wood to make constructions, we make wood constructions and build them, too. These are 3 tasks. To arrange everything*| *|  a portico, a table, an orator, as we attend to catholic scouts. On the other hand, girls usually get tasks like cooking, cleaning the tent and also, for example, dealing with logistics issues, like demarcating spaces, because*| *|  the truth is that experience tells me that girls have a great organizational skill and*| *|  of space and resources management. So, sometimes, girls are much more in charge of decisions and boys of executing certain plans. And this also demonstrates that girls sometimes are also related to these tasks and boys too, and girls are more into intellectual tasks and boys are more into physical tasks. (*| *| ) I repeat: this is a tendency. But scouts don’t discriminate, this is not a rule, I mean, dividing girls to one side with less physical tasks and boys with more physical ones to the other side, it isn’t it. Because this is what usually happens, we do it all together. (*| *| 14 | (*| *| ) |*| 15 | R: (*| *| ) When I go camping with my friends, this didn’t happened but it has been happening, there is a clear division of tasks between men and women according with their physical ability and I think that, for a better use (of the resources/capabilities) and for better results, it should be this way.  Boys usually have more skills for physical tasks that need body work and girls usually have more skills for tasks more*| *|  more*| *|  tasks that need more touch and more*| *|  more*| *|  expertise*| *|  more intellectual capacity and not so physical. This is a tendency, it’s not a rule, but usually, both girls and boys, accept these behaviour patterns. |*| 17 | R: Yes, I do, I believe that it should be this way, not there it should be constraints for a boy to cook nor for a girl to make constructions, because, in fact, that happens*| *|  but I agree that we should take advantage of girls and boys abilities. |

And I think that you also can see it nowadays, perhaps. (*| *| ) These are decisions that I can understand (*| *| ) I think that in what boys and girls are concerned, some will suffer more dangers than others (*| *| ). |*| 3 | R: I assume that some parents are afraid that*| *|  I don’t know*| *|  that girls will be robbed*| *|  I don’t know*| *|  who knows, raped, abused, I don’t know, sexual abused, and other things. And I think that some things are more susceptible to happen to boys and other to girls. I think that more easily, at least in my opinion, a cell phone pacific rob approach, that kind of things, without too much violence, is more susceptible to happen to boys, meanwhile girls, for example,  are more susceptible to be sexual abused, obviously. I don’t remember any male friend of mine complaining that: “I was sexually accosted”. (*| *| *|  |*| 5 | R: Yes, in that time, I only went out with male friends.

I just*| *|  remember that they said that they couldn’t go out because their parents didn’t let them do it. But it’s always the same story, they don’t want their daughters to start drinking alcohol at night, they don’t that their daughters flirting with boys, but it’s more the opposite of boys flirting with girls, right? I think that this has to do with that: alcohol, boys, eventually, drugs, I don’t know, smoking, and other things. |*| 9 | R: No, in this case it has to do with other things. I think that, once more, there are some complementary criteria: my parents trusted me a lot, I think that I can say it with confidence, because they always believed in the values they passed me, and all the safety issues, all the responsibility that I was supposed to have, they believed that I got it (*| *| ) I think that they really trusted me to let me go out when I was 14 years old; I think it’s soon enough, right? (*| *| ) This doesn’t mean that the majority of my female friends parents didn’t think they weren’t responsible, but maybe they thought they were more susceptible of some dangers when they were going out, and even if they trusted them there are things that don’t depend on them (*| *| ). I think that girls are more responsible than boys sooner than them. Well, this is a little bit contradictory: why did parents let boys go out sooner when supposedly, and I believe that this is right, girls are more responsible than us. |*| *| ). But I think that it would have been really (emphasis on this word) if I were a girl, without any doubts. (*| *| ) |*| 13 | R: Yes. I think that this is spreadable to other things like daily life things (*| *| ). For example, having coffee in the afternoon with friends*| *|  small things that I remember from that time like using the subway; for example, for me it was a perfectly normal thing and I remember that in that time, I don’t know if it happened because I attended a private school in which I believe that there was, supposedly, a higher social class (*| *| ) I remember that almost none of my female friends used the bus; someone would take them to school, fathers, mothers, even motorists, or they used the school bus and they had to wait for it. But in what public buses are concerned I remember perfectly that, once more, only my male friends used it, and this is a thing that I believe that it is a perfectly quotidian thing and there is this distinction that still I understand, but girls will also be exposed to the same dangers (*| *| ). |*| 15 | R: Well, I understand. I mean that usually girls are more fragile than us and maybe there are some situations, like a robbery or an approach like this, I don’t know, that are more significant for a girl than for a boy, in a way that I can think that if a male friend of mine was robbed, he would be able to use the bus again, and if it was a girl, it would be more difficult to her to do it again so easily before an approach like this. |*| 16 | (*| *| ) |*| 18 | R: In what going out at night is concerned or*| *| ? |*| 20 | R: Well, in theory, no. I think that I would try to pass the same values to each other (*| *| ). In practice, I don’t know if it would be that way. Well, from my experience and bearing in mind the things I just told you, I think that going out nowadays*| *|  I still think that some boys are extremely abusive and girls not so much (*| *| ). Maybe I wouldn’t let my daughter go out earlier than a son of mine. (*| *| ) |*| *| ) I think that nowadays things begin to happen sooner and maybe boys and girls have other kind of pressure (*| *| *| *| ) |*| 24 | (*| *| ) |*| 25 | R: (*| *| *|  but I think that if the message was well transmitted in what values are concerned, if a son of mine did things respectfully with all girls, well, it wouldn’t be a problem that, in a certain time, each one could try when they wanted. (*| *| ) I think that girls aren’t prepared to deal so soon with this kind of pressure, sincerely (*| *| ). |*| 27 | R: I think so*| *|  I think that boys are a bit more prepared, because they aren’t so easily approached for that kind of things, meanwhile girls are more easily approached for that kind of things, I mean that I don’t see so many 14-years-old girls approaching boys for sexual relations but, for example, I can see lots of boys of that age doing it. |*| 29 | R: (*| *| ) these kind of sexual curiosities happen sooner to boys than to girls; eventually that’s why it happens. But the fact is that it happens, and back in my time it already happened. I remember that I and my friends commented on our usual conversations that we all lost our virginity sooner than our female friends, I perfectly remember it. It was natural. So, why does it happen? I don’t know, but it is evidence that usually boys, well, in my time, my friends, all of us had that kind of experiences sooner than our female friends, perhaps 2 years sooner. (*| *| ) I would more easily let a 16-years-old son of mine start to go out than a daughter of mine. |*| 31 | R: (*| *| ) if it was today, I think that the ideal age would be*| *|  I don’t want to be really mean, but 17 years old (*| *| ). Maybe for my son it would be 15 years old. It was the age that I started going out, 14/15 years old. |

So, the first story I remember is about one of my Secondary teachers, a Physical Education male teacher, that in a perfect equal situation between me and a female colleague of mine, a situation in which we were both doing exactly the same, in an attempt of discipline and reprehend us, he was much more severe with me. And extrapolating this to generality, this is a thing that happens often; in school and in university, girls have, normally*| *|  or, male teachers are more careful, usually, more*| *|  I don’t know*| *|  they have a different treatment with girls, they are more careful with them in the way they speak, and usually in how they reprehend (*| *| ) |*| 3 | R: I don’t know. I don’t think that is has to do with a feeling*| *|  or maybe male professors think that, a feeling of fragility and sensibility. I think that it hasn’t to do with sex (*| *| ). It doesn’t make sense to me to have that kind of behaviour distinctions. I even believe that they aren’t done on purpose, but I think that there is a little bit this*| *|  I don’t know*| *|  this way of male teachers acting like this with students: to be calmer, more careful, even to be more tolerant with girls than with boys. |*| 5 | R: I think that with boys, they usually, it’s not a matter of niceness, but in discomfort situations in which they have to reprehend, or not only on reprehensions, in situations not so agreeable, usually they are much more severe in transmitting that message, it’s not so pleasant for us. If it is a girl they are much more careful, I don’t know, in a way of not hurting susceptibilities, they don’t want someone to be extremely chocked, or maybe they think girls are more fragile, they think they will start crying or something like that; it is a thing that, in fact, I have seen happening, but I don’t think it is because they are girls. It had to do with the person itself. I never saw a male friend of mine crying, that is a fact, because of something like this, but I think that maybe they feel as bad as girl in a situation that is similar to both. |*| 7 | R: I don’t know. (*| *| 8 | (*| *| ) |*| 10 | R: Right. |*| 12 | R: Actually, before I didn’t distinguished that situation, but I think that female teachers tend to have a treatment more coherent with male and female students. So, yes, I think that, specifically, male teachers need to be a little bit calmer in the way they are with girls and boys. |*| *| ) Do male teachers have a more aggressive behaviour with boys? Why do you think that happens? |*| 14 | R: Sincerely, I don’t know. I think that they don’t tend to be more aggressive with us, but they tend to be milder with girls (*| *| ). I think that they are more like “themselves” with us, I mean, with us they usually are a person more brute and harsh in the way they talk with us and with girls, obviously, they are careful. (*| *| ) |*| 16 | R: Yes, I have no doubts of that. |*| 17 | (*| *| ) |*| 19 | R: We were basically standing side by side being reprehended for the same thing. Firstly he talked to me in an unprofessional, unethical, not pedagogical tone, everything that you can remember; and then, basically, he talked with my female colleague in a calmer and clearly less severe tone. It was really different. |*| 20 | (*| *| ) |*| 22 | R: I remember that in that time, in spite of not being a marking thing for me, I confess that when I was being reprehended I didn’t feel bad. Although, when I saw the milder way he was talking to my female colleague I felt extremely frustrated. (*| *| ) independently of the person’s sex, we have to be equal for the good and bad things, right? So, sincerely, I think that I felt really angry in that time. I remember of being extremely angry, but then I went through with it. I am a really calm person, but I felt a bit angry, because nowadays there is no sense of having this kind of treatments.

I saw it through my sister, we have 2 years difference from each other, she’s older than me, and we almost started going out at the same time (*| *| ). In this I do noticed that boys always began going out much sooner than girls, because, in my point of view, wrongly, parents always think that boys are, I don’t say responsible because I didn’t feel it, parents think they aren’t so fragile, maybe. (*| *| ) Going out instigated them some insecurity and, in fact, not having a boy or a man nearby that couldn’t protect us, I think it’s more a matter of protection that of irresponsibility. (*| *| ) Because sometimes boys started going out sooner and then their parents stepped back because they were irresponsible, right? (*| *| ) Boys went out sooner and till later hours, eventually. We went out but in a certain hour (we had to be at home) and if we were 5 minutes late it was a problem. And we had to go home together, even if we had different friends we had to go home together or*| *|  Why? It was that thing of protection because we weren’t a boy but we were 2 and felt more supported, that’s the way they thought. |*| 4 | R: Well, I began going out in the afternoon maybe when I was 14 years old (*| *| ) and my sister was, probably, 16, more or less. (*| *| ) And then I must have been going out in the afternoon for 2 years and behaving well (laughs) so that maybe around 16/17 years old, I don’t know, I was able to go out at night, maybe going to the caf*| é*|  and being at home at midnight, and then, step by step, a person gets older and they (parents) trust more in us, people are more, more, more adults and not so fragile, I think it’s just like that. |*| 6 | R: (*| *| ) usually the excuse they used was that it wasn’t time for girls, let’s say so, young girls to be alone on the street. We didn’t live very far away from the caf*| é*|  we usually went, but maybe it was like 10 minutes walking. And, in fact, in the afternoon it was a very situation (*| *| ), but at night (*| *| ) if we had a male neighbour or a male cousin, etc., that unfortunately we didn’t have, because if we had it would had helped, but it was more a matter of safety than anything else. It wasn’t what we were going to do; it was the route till we get to our friends, our acquaintances, and not if we were drinking coffee, if we smoked, if there were those normal teenage problems*| *|  (*| *| ) But I think that it had more to do with safety on the street than those adolescence dangers we talk about nowadays. |*| 7 | (*| *| ) |*| 8 | R: (*| *| ) What I see in people today, the current parents, what I see is that there isn’t that safety on the street concern and there is more that adolescence concerns, right? The unwanted pregnancies in the beginning of the adolescence, smoking, and drinking till fall down. These situations are, in fact, seen earlier now and in our time it was unthinkable that with 10 years old or 12 years old people began going out and be on the street till 4.00 am in the morning and go to the (name hospital unit), as I see them, with high levels of alcohol in the blood, and this is beginning to happen. (*| *| ) |*| 10 | R: No, it’s much less visible now. I think that what counts now is the age factor. (*| *| ) I think that both girls and boys go out. It depends on the education their parents had. But, in fact, it’s not because of being a woman or a man that they go out later or sooner. I don’t feel it. |*| 12 | R: I think it’s correct. I don’t understand why a boy can start going out sooner and a girl not. No, not that. I never agreed and even years ago I didn’t agree, because, in fact, the insecurity lived on the streets is the same for men and women, right? (*| *| 13 | (*| *| ) |*| 14 | R: They (boys) are! In my daily life outside (the hospital), I don’t feel it, it’s more because of the job I have. (*| *| ) |*| 16 | R: Perhaps they have a more understanding attitude with boys. Maybe, I don’t know, it has to do with what I was telling you before that, in my time, they thought that boys had more skills to overcome and get better, as they say (*| *| ), and it’s not so bad a boy being drunk than their daughter who they thought that she didn’t drink and didn’t do anything and they let her go out and then she goes to (name hospital unit). There is still this differentiation between boys and girls. |*| 18 | R: No, no, no. We don’t do that. I don’t see it.

In fact, being a woman didn’t have so much influence in applying for a nursing academic course. My sister was already a nurse and perhaps that has directed me to that area, in spite of the fact that I always liked of helping people, and if it wasn’t nursing, it would be something directed for being with people and trying to help. |*| 3 | R: Well, it started before being the real role of nurses. Who took care of patients were nuns. And nuns can only be women. Priests didn’t take care of patients. And, in fact, it began just like that: first they needed to be religious and catholic women, etc.; then it evolved a little bit, they didn’t have to be a nun, but it was compulsory to be a woman. (*| *| ). According with some bibliography that I read (*| *| ), maybe patients feel more comfortable if it is a woman taking care of them and not a man. (*| *| ) Maybe in the beginning women were associated to be sweeter, more attentive, tenderer (*| *| ). |*| 5 | R: Yes, yes, yes. I can feel a lot of difference if the patient is a man or a woman. But, of course, it depends of the health treatments we are talking about. If it goes in the privacy of the patient (*| *| ) In this case, men obviously prefer male nurses and not female, and the opposite also happens. It is more visible in the older people. Older people are more*| *|  have more modesty, they are more ashamed for showing certain parts of their body, right? (*| *| ) they always ask if there is someone of the same sex. It’s not so visible in other people. The younger ones don’t even talk about it. |*| 7 | R: Women. Girls. Without any doubt! And still there are mostly women applying for it, without any doubt. Maybe, I don’t know, I don’t know to explain why, because I see male colleagues of mine that in their general activities are so much masculine, right? And then take care of patients just like or even better than many female colleagues. In fact, it is changing a little bit, but still there are more women. |*| 9 | R: I say “so much masculine”, because sometimes you think that choosing nursing, as it was so connoted as feminine and as a profession in which you should have some delicacy, some tenderness that men aren’t like that, there are many people who think that way (*| *| ) |*| 10 | (*| *| ) |*| 12 | R: My service’s team (name of hospital unit), I work in the (name of hospital unit) here in the hospital, has more women even so, we are 32 people and maybe it’s like 20 women for 12 men, more or less. And as teams are rotated, there are shifts where you work only with women, and others that you work with mixed teams. |*| 13 | (*| *| ) |*| 14 | R: (*| *| ) In fact, maybe sometimes people are more surprised, let’s say it, when there is a tenderer man, giving better health treatments, etc. And maybe they (patients) try to demonstrate it more, because they think a woman, in this case a female nurse, is already like that, I mean, they already think that female nurses are tenderer, sweeter (*| *| ). So, when they (patients) see a good male nurse they try to extol that situation and they value it. |*| 15 | (*| *| ) |*| 16 | R: (*| *| ) in what professions and leisure access are concerned, there were ones mostly feminine and others mostly masculine. I think that it is, more and more, dissolved and it’s not too visible now. |*| 18 | R: Well, politics, although it is changing now, I think that, honestly, it’s more masculine, right? In sports where they are paid for it, like football, it is clearly more, more masculine*| *|  in things like cars, auto service, more heavy work, like, carpentry (*| *| ) everything that has more to do with*| *|  physical strength, not so psychological but physical strength is more directed to men. And what is more delicate, more understanding, more intuitive, is more for women. (*| *| ) in every profession, these things that I just said is less happening and there is a tendency, in fact, for having always a mix (of men and women) in every profession. |

Even we, health professionals (*| *| ), we can’t judge, but sometimes between us we let become visible a little bit that it’s more usual for women, and it isn’t so hard for us. And when a man comes up in these situations and he complains, we are like: “How is this possible?”, and we joke a little bit, well, it’s our own defences (for the hard work they do and the situations they deal with), between the team unit we joke a little bit and say: “how is it possible that the man let himself be beaten by his wife?”. And, in fact, if it is a woman, this doesn’t happen. In fact, there is a big difference between men and women here. |*| 3 | R: Yes. |*| 5 | R: Maybe it’s the habit, let’s say that, and the mentality that people still have. And it has also to do with the media, because it always let become visible, when it talks about it, that the situations of domestic violence are always done by men against women, women appear hurt and women appear dead, and, in fact, it doesn’t talk too much about men and it actually happens (to them). (*| *| ) Because there are many men that, due to the discomfort that society, friends, neighbours will instil them, close themselves more and, maybe, they live their whole life suffering from domestic violence and don’t tell it because of the burden that comes next. And for women it’s a more common situation, they don’t mind of revealing it and try to change the situation. |*| 6 | (*| *| ) |*| 8 | R: Maybe it is*| *|  in what women are concerned, the fact of being domestic violence victims, the fact of telling more easily to a female nurse than a male one. Perhaps for shame, let’s say so, of the connotation that society gives*| *|  and for men it’s even worse! A man going to (name hospital unit) to tell that he was a victim of domestic violence to a male nurse*| *|  I don’t know if it happens, because we don’t talk too much about it and it’s not a situation that allows talking due to the professional secrecy. Although, in my opinion, bearing in mind the situations that we perceive, in this special cases, maybe they’ll feel much more comfortable talking with a woman, because they think that she will understand better the situation and because of the society connotation of this being a shame. So: “I won’t tell a man that my wife hit me!”. And in this aspect they’ll have more difficulty, but it doesn’t mean that they won’t do it. |*| 10 | R: I do. |

What I say is that, since the beginning, I have always considered equal the work of men and women. We worked for the State, we were both teachers, my wife is no longer a teacher (she’s retired), we applied a principle, more than usual, that is who has children takes care of them, who has no money has no addictions. Because we were teachers, we were lucky to be able to always educate our children, so it was always there the father or the mother, till they were able to go to kindergarten (*| *| ) when there are many of people (at home), I cook.

In spite of being possible for male and female to cooperate, in the majority of the situations, who has more work, taking care, etc., etc., it’s the female. And I think that in what humans are concerned this role isn’t reduced, it isn’t eliminated, and it would be more and more important*| *|  What happens is that society’s development and women’s options, their independence desires, that are more than legitimate, but women’s independence doesn’t mean not understanding a certain thing nor, for me, to deny that in the first years of a child’s life, the role of the mother is much more important than the father’s. Much more important! And if the presence of the mother isn’t there, in medium/long term, the child, the youngster, the adult will resent it. |*| 6 | (*| *| ) |*| 7 | R: (*| *| *|  I think it’s fundamental.

All the rest, taking care, giving affection, etc., etc., I think I could do it. So, the absence of the mother wouldn’t be noticed from this point of view, but from genetics point of view, I really don’t know how it is, I think there is a component that determines later the future behaviour and if that component doesn’t exist, I think that the person’s development would be at risk. |*| 11 | R: (*| *| ) There has been an evolution essentially derived not from men’s understanding about the relevance of equality of men and women, but women’s relevance was essentially dictated, in the majority of societies and ours, I suppose, it was imposed for economic reasons. (*| *| ) In the 50’s/60’s, for me, there were reasons, economical reasons that lead women to the labour market. (*| *| ) Their role in household economy turned to be important because of the salary they brought, in spite of the fact of being a lower salary, as the salary inequalities always existed and still exists today. It became more and more indispensable. So, besides their job as a worker, it was added the mother’s work, aggravated by men’s general mentality that thought that household tasks, children’s education, etc., etc., always were women’s duties, because it was what they saw in their parents, grandparents, and so on, when they looked to the past. They saw that and they didn’t question themselves because they thought that it was what good women do and, many times, they still had the nerve of saying that women didn’t work, because if even they were at home working and had a dozen of children to raise, the husband would have the nerve to say that she didn’t work. |*| 12 | (*| *| ) |*| 13 | R: (*| *| ) I haven’t lived it, but that was something I felt and heard on conversations, etc., etc., and it was chocking to me, because that sex’s inequality was seen and faced naturally. (*| *| ) |*| 15 | R: Lesser, but still exists*| *|  (*| *| ) you just need to see the number of divorces or separations, or as church notices it, the number of marriages have been falling down, and so on. This has more to do with women’s affirmation, because she was oppressed, but I think there is an abdication from both, each one with a certain guilty. |

It’s frightening! It’s frightening in Spain, and it’s frightening in Portugal. (*| *| ) the acts are frightening, as the behaviour of people are, men and women, etc., etc., etc., when they know that the male neighbour, because exceptionally will be the woman to abuse men, but it also exists, is abusing (a woman) in every single different ways, verbal, physical, even getting to death, and people shrug their shoulders off, they say it’s not their business, and they resign from all responsibility and attempt of modifying this situation. |*| 2 | (*| *| ) |*| 3 | R: (*| *| ) before it wasn’t heard, it wasn’t reported in the news, but it doesn’t mean that it didn’t exist, it always existed along the times. (*| *| ) I think that culturally and economically, women started generally to earn more and more quickly than men, and related to that they weren’t opened to bare certain kind of lives, etc., etc., or certain kind of treatment, etc., etc., and easily came the divorce, and then men’s mentality practically didn’t change: if before they viewed women as property, as a furniture, a car, etc., many of them do this (use violence), and this hasn’t to do with social classes, it’s transversal. It has to do with what you have and don’t have. But they continue to say “my” wife as they were talking about a car or other good that belongs to family patrimony or his private sphere, they don’t accept that, and it explains all the rest, besides in some situations it could be pathological too, there are both things, the disease part and the cultural part. |*| 4 | (*| *| ) |*| 6 | R: For those who practice violence I think it is, because it is based in strength.

And the violence begins to be verbal and then turns to be physical. And it only is physical because someone is capable of hitting in other one, if not it wouldn’t exist. It’s the strong sex in that way, in what strength is concerned. |

(*| *| ) so, it was a very low percentage. In the end of the graduation degree, I don’t know how many men, but only 3 girls got the diploma. It was right in that moment that I felt a great difference because of being a woman, but I didn’t feel discriminated. |*| 2 | (*| *| ) |*| 3 | R: (*| *| ) I looked for a builders company where it had a position for construction director. We were in the early 90’s and there were very few women in construction in Portugal. (*| *| ) I was interviewed, it was difficult to be admitted, but I was admitted as a construction director. I was, in that time, 23 years old. I didn’t feel discriminated; I was admitted at the same time as my young male co-workers, with the same salary, I didn’t feel discriminated in what salary is concerned. By the way, in what salary is concerned, I never felt discriminated in these 18 years of work, comparing with people who do the same job and that are male. But, as I was saying, when I got in, I went to work on constructions as construction director. Well, perhaps, I even felt I little bit more welcomed than my male co-workers, because builders, all of them much older, thought we were college boys and didn’t understand anything at all of the business, but they had respect for me, because I always kept a certain distance in order to not to have any problem for being a woman, right? So, boys said that: “Oh, they treat you with more respect”. |*| 4 | (*| *| ) |*| 5 | R: In my company, in the 90’s, (*| *| ) in 400 construction directors we had 10 women and the rest were men. Nowadays we only have 2 female construction directors, because female construction directors have been being directed to other areas. Firstly I was directed to the office, then for training, which also is in the office. Others were directed to budget, others to other areas of the company, and, in this moment, there only are 2 in the field. We have to recognize that, in Portugal, not in the company I work for, but in other companies in general, there is a great feminine presence, well, great is relative, but, there is a feminine presence; but, in constructions, women always occupy side positions to production, I mean, women in Portugal work in constructions but they work in areas such as safety, quality, environment, some in the supervising area, but women rarely assume power, I mean, rarely they are construction directors, production directors. So, they are in parallel lines, but never in the direct line of power in a construction. That was what happened when I was a construction director and, in the 90’s, when my female co-workers, we were in the pyramid top in a construction, so we were the only feminine character, we were the top! We gave orders to everyone. In this moment, my female co-workers that are in these areas, they do not give orders, they are like a sort of*| *|  consultancy*| *|  adjunct to men that are, they do are, the construction directors and they do give orders. |*| 6 | (*| *| ) |*| 7 | R: Because society still sees a lot maternity and not only in construction directors; so being a mom in Portugal, we need babies, but being a mom in Portugal is a real trouble for any administration board in a company. When a person comes and says she’s pregnant it’s like the worst news you could give, right? And it’s not only being pregnant, it’s what a little child implies. Behalf on trying to not be absent with family help or external help, they always look at us as potential people that are going to be absent to go to the pediatrician, they will be absent because they are going to take the child to school, because they are going to school meetings. And it still is seen in Portuguese society that when a man, in the middle of the afternoon, says: “I need to leave early to pick my car at the car repair” nobody notices, but when a mom, in the middle of the afternoon, says: “I need to leave early because they called me from the kindergarten saying that my son has fever”, everyone looks at us. And I think that is still true in Portuguese society. And I think that women are not in construction directors positions because the construction director position is very demanding, it demands many hours of work, I don’t say it isn’t true, it demands a lot of availability, and adding to the situation that we have to invest in abroad markets, in internationalization. So, it is much easier to men, even letting his family in Portugal, to let go and go to Brazil, than a mom. (*| *| ) It is much more complicated the inverse situation, to be the father staying with the children and the mother to go away. So, I think that’s one of the reasons why they are keeping away women from the construction director position, because they don’t really have the availability that men accept to have. I consider that they shouldn’t have to have it. |*| 8 | (*| *| ) |*| *|  |*| 10 | R: (*| *| ) sometimes they put anonymous ads, people answer them and what happens is that, sometimes, female engineers that apply for construction, their curriculums aren’t even assessed, because it’s not what they are looking for. So, if they get those curriculums, envelopes with curriculums from ladies, they are automatically excluded, because it can be the best lady in world, or the best construction director in the world, in this case, but no, no, they aren’t even assessed, nor even seen. So, in that moment, there is a triage between men and women. Because, they continue to support that for a construction director position, in this company, they need men that will be available to go anywhere, at any time and at any hour. So, they continue with the same theory that ladies aren’t*| *|  they have no right. |*| 11 | (*| *| ) |*| 12 | R: It’s because they are potential mothers. Because they can be women that, in their whole lives, will never have children; but if you are a woman you can always become a mom, without premeditating, because of a course accident. So, I think that is because of that, and not because they doubt of our intellectual skills, it’s not because they doubt of our leadership skill. |*| 13 | (*| *| ) |*| 14 | R: (*| *| ) The only times that they told me or that they modified my normal path was due to reasons related to my maternity and my gender. |*| 15 | (*| *| ) |*| *| ) Then I went to university, I attended the same university my father did. I was quite influenced by him. |*| 18 | (*| *| ) |*| 19 | R: We were in a time in which it was expected that, in reality, in construction, women would, not become in equal numbers, but would be close to men. So, we had hope that, in the future, construction would be an equal universe between men and women, right? That was what we expected, but it didn’t happen. Well, at this moment, in 2011, in terms of gender in construction, in my opinion, we receded comparing with the beginning of the 90’s, or in the middle of the 90’s. |*| 20 | (*| *| ) |*| 21 | R: (*| *| ) it isn’t given the same opportunities to women and men, because women are, potentially, moms and they have a different occupation. |*| 23 | R: Because*| *|  a different occupation because they have family concerns, they have family occupations, besides the professional ones. Because I have co-workers that are*| *| 25 | R: Men. Well, as they are stack at the apartment in (name region), in a village where you can find only one caf*| é*|  where they manage to see a football game in SporTV, but there is nothing more, they work almost day and night. They are available to produce and work. Why? Because they arrive at 8.00 pm, they leave the construction dock, they have dinner together and then, perhaps, they go to the apartment but they won’t be standing there looking to each other or watching television, they’ll sit at the laptop and continue working. So, they dedicate completely to that cause and because of that their productivity will be, obviously, higher, because they dedicate it much more hours. If it was a woman, she would work till 8.00 pm like they did, but she would have to go home and make the dinner and take care of her children and worry about their backpack for school and with the exams dates and with this, and with that, so, necessarily, they have other kind of concerns that they (men) don’t have. They only have to call home every night and ask their wives: “So, is it everything ok with the kids?”; “Are the kids ok?”; they speak with their children: “kiss, kiss, kiss, Daddy is working”. And this is what companies want. They want people with total availability, to work hardly for that cause and to transform that construction the most profitable it can be. That’s my opinion. |

But, well, in the day I was back to work, my boss told me that he only had jobs for me in Algarve, Porto or Aveiro. I stared at him incredulous, because he was talking as if I simply hadn’t a 4 months baby at home and if like it wasn’t the first day I was separated from him. (*| *| ) Of course they promised me that I would be away only for 1 or 2 months at maximum, and I came back 6 months after. (*| *| ) I consider that this was a huge discrimination, because, in that time, there were constructions in (name city) area, male co-workers were taking care of those constructions, and we could, perfectly, have made an exchange. So, it was like putting me on a trial: “you’re a woman, you’re a mom, let’s see if you resist to this trial”. At the end, when A (name oldest son) was 10 months old, so, at the end of 6 months of work there, I finally returned, returned to the (name city) area, and after that they didn’t put me again out of my residence area, so I have always been kept in constructions in an area that allowed me to return home, even if they were farer or nearer, but they allowed me to come back home. |*| 2 | Later I had my second child, B (name of the middle son). This time, at the 5 months of pregnancy, I didn’t stay at the office, I worked till the day before B was born, I was really voluminous and heavy, but I worked till the end and continued working. I returned from the B’s maternity leave and continued working. |*| *| ) As I did a good work, recently, I was asked to present a little presentation of the work I developed in 2010 and how I did it, in a meeting with the administration board and the directors: they are 78 men and 3 ladies. And I presented, in that meeting, with other people that also made an intervention, all male, I did a presentation of 10 minutes of my work. So, I consider that, well, I feel proud because they really verified that I developed a work that deserved that presentation to such an honorable audience. |*| 4 | (*| *| ) |*| *| ) my activity as construction director I think I did it well, and it wasn’t because of being a bad constructing director that I was taken away of my functions, that’s why I feel the discrimination. (*| *| ) it was for my condition of being a woman. |*| 8 | R: Aaaaa*| *|  yes*| *|  the fact of being a woman, of being a mom of 3 children, 3 little children, with close ages. And it was clearly for not suiting in what they needed, that are men who are available for letting it all and for going to work to places very far away from one moment to another. |*| 10 | R: No; I didn’t consider the idea of quitting the company because I thought that it would be hard to do the construction director functions with my age, nearly 40, and mother of 3 children, because any company would put me the same obstacles, so I maintained inside the company, where I have a no term contract*| *|  I maintained in company because I belong to the permanent board, and I considered that if I was in a situation of looking for a job in other builder, he would look at me the same way: nearly 40, 3 little children, can’t let go of everything to go abroad, so we aren’t going to bet in a situation like that. (*| *| ) It was really hard for me, as you can imagine. It’s not easy for a person to hear that: “It was you who decided to have children. Now*| *|  hang on it!” |*| 11 | (*| *| ) |*| 12 | R: (*| *| ) when I started working I would never thought that I would be discriminated, after a few years, because of having 3 children. I always thought that*| *|  I considered that I would always have the job I was doing in that moment and that I would never be put aside because of being a mom of 3 children, right? My fear was that I would stop doing those functions due to my incompetence or for happening something that wasn’t directly me responsibility but then it would be attributed to me for a bad management, and that I would be put aside of those functions for an episode like that, and not for a personal and natural situation of life which is having children. |*| 13 | (*| *| ) |*| 14 | R: In this case, unfortunately, my story tells something, it’s an example of the contrary that should have been. It’s precisely the opposite of what it should be. We should be meeting towards an egalitarian society, or*| *|  in which women and men had the same opportunities, shared responsibilities, and in which should have been given equal opportunities independently of being a woman or a man. |

As I was a little girl and my father thought he wouldn’t be able to comply with the schedules of taking me and picking me up every day by car; I was living like what? 4/5/6 Km from (name city). I stayed intern in the (name of private nun’s school), because that way they would take me on Monday morning, they would pick me up at Saturday, right, because on Saturday we still had classes, because I couldn’t get a bus as I was a girl. |*| 2 | (*| *| ) |*| *| ) The first story you told me about, you were intern in a private school. That school was only for girls? |*| 4 | R: Yes, yes. In that time, it was only for girls. (*| *| ) so, as long as I studied, there was a private school for girls and there was a private school for boys, because I was in one of girls and my brother was in one of boys. |*| 6 | R: In that time it was like that. Even then, when I was working as a teacher, they started to*| *|  as long as high schools were already mixed, primary schools could be*| *|  how can I explain this? They could be mixed but with separated classrooms for girls and for boys. I was already working when they began to be allowed to be together in playtime. The sign that they could be together was because they destroyed the wall, the wall that separated the masculine part from the feminine part. |*| 7 | (*| *| ) |*| *| ) Were your private school and your brother’s private school in different places? |*| 9 | R: Right, different places. |*| 10 | (*| *| ) |*| 11 | R: We were both interns but each one in each private school. |*| 13 | R: Right, I shouldn’t. And then he thought that his son also*| *|  he was so little*| *|  go by bus or not? It was better that each one stays intern in their own private school and we’ll be tranquil. |*| 15 | R: I don’t know. Maybe because I was a girl. There weren’t many people traveling by bus. I think that it’s because of that that nowadays I feel well traveling by bus. As I wasn’t able to travel by bus when I was a girl, now I enjoy it a lot. It was maybe*| *|  it was an opinion he had. He thought that*| *|  perhaps, if it was now, he wouldn’t think that way, because now public transports are made for everyone and they are much more used. But in that time no. (*| *| ) But he thought that a girl couldn’t use it. I started working and he, if I didn’t go by car, he would take me to the school where I worked and would pick me up. So, I was working for a long time when I started using the bus. |*| 17 | R: Perhaps, perhaps he thought that; he felt much safer when he took me and picked me up than using a public transport. |*| 19 | R: Ah, in the private the school we had rules. Well, it was a nun’s private school. In the morning, we got up, we had the church celebration, (*| *| ). And we had the study schedules, but without a really rigid discipline, delivering but without rigidness. |*| 20 | (*| *| ) |*| 22 | R: No, no, no. I don’t defend that. I think that*| *|  if you have respect it’s not a problem being just girls or just boys, or boys and girls together. It’s all a matter of respect with each other and of mentality. Because if we think to ourselves that together we can know each other, we can help each other, but without*| *|  without that competition, without that superiority or inferiority complex. And, many times, that hovers in the air in many places. And I think that it continues to be really harmful. |*| *|  |*| 24 | R: We had classes. After classes we had that part of playtime, he had the meals, and we had that time for playing. So, we had time for playing. We weren’t compelled, as some private schools that had all those schedules for everything. (*| *| ) Because we did the things we had to do without being imposed.

There weren’t any problems. |*| 26 | R: Some did. Some did because they weren’t used to it. (*| *| ) There were 2 or 3 (male colleagues), more or less, of our age; the others were much older.  |*| 27 | (*| *| ) |*| 28 | R: (*| *| ) they (older male colleagues) looked at us from up their shoulder. |*| 29 | (*| *| ) |*| *|  As it was an academic course for girls, do you think it was right to have men graduating? |*| 31 | R: I didn’t see any problem in that, because men also are teachers. So, they also have to study so that they can graduate. And we also had male teachers. (*| *| ) I never felt a different treatment from me to them or from them to me, nor for better nor for worse. We were all together and*| *|  I think that it was even healthy. If we were getting out of there for active life, well, in active life we wouldn’t be finding only female teachers or only male teachers. We have to know how to connect with each other. So, I never noticed anything different. |*| 33 | R: In that time, well, my brother wasn’t able to graduate because it was the time of Ultramar’s War. So, he didn’t finish his graduation.

He didn’t want it, because he was already matriculated in (name city) (*| *| ) |*| 35 | R: In Engineering. |*| 36 | (*| *| ) |*| 37 | R: But they (parents) didn’t influence that much. They thought*| *|  it was more for the girls, because they liked that all girls had a profession of not dealing with everyone. I have the impression that it also had to do with the concept that, sometimes, you went to a place and heard people less gentle with who was there. So, I think it has to do with that. But in his choice that didn’t influence it (*| *| ). |*| 39 | R: No, I didn’t have only female colleagues, I also had male colleagues. (*| *| ) There were 2 ladies, teachers, my mom’s friends, that had the same age my mom’s, and all the time we had trainings or other things, they always wanted to work as a team, it was them who formed it, it was the 2 of them, and me with the other male colleague. This male colleague loved, still even today loves, loves to talk. And he speaks really well. So, I took all the notes, in the end I gave him the notes, and our group was always the best one (laughs). |*| 40 | (*| *| ) |*| 42 | R: No, no.

But when I was 21 years old, as soon as I turned 21, I got my driver’s license. |*| 2 | (*| *| ) |*| 4 | R: Yes. In that time, well, I already had my driver’s license, I had my car, and I drove the car. It was only in the beginning that my father took me and picked me up. But that was for a short time. Because as soon as I turned 21 years old I got my driver’s license and I drove the car. |*| 6 | R: Correct. As soon as he turned 18, because in that time it had to be at 18 years old, it was the emancipation, because you only were an adult at 21 years old. But my father told me: “Oh daughter, you really don’t need it, right? So, when you are 21*| *| ”. So, my father thought it was his responsibility. My father gave the graduation course, but he also had to give this. That also was a part of it. And it was really funny to see people in the streets, because they were too admired to see a girl driving, it wasn’t normal in that time (smile with satisfaction). There was a sir that lived up there and he came down here and said to his wife: “I like so much to come down here to see the little lady driving” (laughs).

Like, for example, if people got married before 21 years old, parents had to authorize it. It was that. (*| *| ) |*| 22 | R: Yes, it was. Parents had to give an authorization to who hadn’t 21 years old to be considered as an adult. If only at 21 years old you were considered an adult, before that age parents had to authorize. |*| 24 | R: No, I got married after that. |*| 25 | (*| *| ) |*| 26 | R: (*| *| ) I never felt any difference about being a woman.

Then he called my father to tell him that he found the little lady: “I only saw her from the back; she was with a boy”. He didn’t see that the boy was my brother! (laughs) So, there were different ways of seeing things. My father laughed and said: “ah, well, she was with a boy. A little bit taller than she is?”; “Yes.”; “Perhaps it was her brother”. |*| 31 | (*| *| ) |*| 33 | R: I don’t know. Perhaps not. Perhaps not.

Well, it is a service in the textiles, the wool products business, more properly said. And then, it was there that, as a man, I had to follow my career, starting as a weaver; I was a spooler, a weaver, and then I reached a leading position (*| *| ). |*| 3 | R: I do, because a woman would have difficulties in doing what I did. |*| 5 | R: I was loom refiner, of machines. Not only of looms, but of all machines. (*| *| ) |*| 7 | R: I was a weaver that is the first job in this service of making fabric (*| *| ).  |*| 8 | (*| *| ) |*| 9 | R: I made a request, if it was possible to candidate to the weaver position, “Yes, it is”. I got in, it’s like this that this service goes and, then, I got in. Then, by my own merit, I went through (*| *| ). And I was like that 20 years, with 8 machines. |*| 11 | R: Yes. I never saw a woman, not even have seen it, because it is diffuse, a lady doesn’t fit very well in that place. There are places for her inside (*| *| ). What I did there it was for men. (*| *| ) |*| 13 | R: Yes, there were, like in the conclusion phase. The conclusion is the final part of the cloth, it is the conclusion. And there, women who insert the thread had to see and take out the defects machines do (*| *| ). |*| 15 | R: Yes. |*| 16 | (*| *| ) |*| 18 | R: All men. All men. And still are men. |*| 20 | R: Yes. (*| *| ) |*| 22 | R: No, they don’t. It’s like I say, it’s difficult for a woman to do that there, isn’t it? A woman as to turn upside down to go to the spot*| *|  there are breakdowns that can’t be solved in another way. There are machines that are in the perpendicular of the loom and then a woman has to dive, a woman*| *|  I don’t know! I know a city (name of a city in Portugal) that is centenarian in the fabric business and I never saw a woman doing this. |*| 24 | R: No, they weren’t*| *|  I don’t know if they were capable of. They could be. Because today women are intelligent. Nowadays, women manage and do everything. But back in that time they didn’t want that, it didn’t become a habit. I would actually say that it didn’t become a habit to put women in that position (*| *| ) |*| 25 | (*| *| ) |*| 26 | R: [They] wanted to launch women [in the business] because their labour was cheaper, so, in order to not to give so much to one, they would give less to other, and then with 2 they would make 1. (*| *| ) It isn’t a proper place for a lady. She, in the fabric business, it’s like I say, women have a fundamental role: to grab the cloth and select it, prepare it; that will become a suit, it will become cloth to make suits. It is the conclusion phase. But, then, women have other positions (*| *| ). I don’t know how it is today (*| *| ) but I know that there are refiner women. |*| *| ) Making a distinction between the tasks of women and men, yours had more prestige and you earned more, wasn’t it? |*| 28 | R: Exactly. |*| 29 |   |*| 30 | (*| *| ) |*| 32 | R: No, she already earned money.

The business owner always opts, even if needed to pay more, for men. (*| *| ) |*| 45 | R: Because men work a little more, I mean, men don’t talk much, women are troublemakers. |*| 46 | (*| *| ) |*| 47 | R: Every person that is in a leading position prefers to have 50 men and not having 20 women. Women cause trouble, are troublemakers. (*| *| ) A woman is*| *|  she has her own personality. They (women) even said: “where there are 2 women there is always a war”. (*| *| ) |*| 49 | R: They preferred men, they worked more. They weren’t so absent, if women had menstrual problems they missed work, if women had problems of something they missed work, then there was the children breastfeeding (*| *| ). If I were the business owner, more properly said, would I make different? Nothing! I would do the same they all do. |*| 50 | (*| *| ) |*| 51 | R: The business owners, nowadays, in this city, or other, also opt more for men, for men’s labour, as I said, it is more personalized, more hardworking, less tragic than women, because women are more flawed.

And there is practically no chance that they could be competent workers of this sphere of activity. And here, I felt that all our teachers were somehow preparing us, men for the jobs typically in construction supervision, typically at the construction site, typically performing concrete tasks, whereas our women, our girls were being prepared for work in planning and design companies, as building projects estimators, as persons who will be dealing rather with preparatory works, accounting but not in direct supervision. In short, our teachers could not imagine a situation, when a woman wearing rubber boots would have to climb a bulldozer or take measurements with theodolite. This we could not imagine*| *|  This our teachers could not imagine*| *|  and actually neither could we. It was connected not only to the psychological construction but also physical one. Our girls were petite, delicate and absolutely nobody could see them*| *|  probably even they did not see themselves doing these jobs that by definition were supposed to be the content of our future profession. So here one could feel and it was such a first feeling in this secondary school of a clear difference, clear segregation between us, that is men who are going to work, build, create and women, who will be in design studios, accounting and will be dealing with construction in this soft meaning.  |*| 4 | R: I mean, comments maybe too, however, it was not put so decidedly and sharply. But it manifested itself, for instance, in the fact that us, as boys, we had to - let’s say in the area of construction works - describe how to prepare a construction site, so this practical place of action, whereas girls were asked more about the way they would make an inventory at the construction site, what should be there, how it should be arranged. To translate it into a household situation, this man had to arrange the house or apartment, whereas a woman would furnish it. So it looked more or less like this. And there was also some correlation with the questions asked during oral exams. Of course, questions given at written exams were the same for men and women, however, these more direct questions that consisted in oral examining were very often softer, warmer, not so focused on the still rather brutal part of the work on construction sites, where still at that time everything had to be mainly done manually. There was not much mechanized equipment. So, probably it was demonstrated mainly in such areas.  |*| *|  in such school context? |*| 6 | R: Yes, in the school context, as well as later on*| *|  I am an engineer by profession, so these correlations afterwards already as a technician or engineer*| *|  these correlations were totally different. A male engineer was more looked for, more gladly employed, better remunerated. He had a completely different position. It was very difficult for a woman to reach such position and she had to demonstrate much more skills and*| *| , which by the way, she even did not often have opportunity to show since the possibilities of verification of knowledge and skills were also very small. So here, I felt this privilege and maybe especially in these technical professions of mine.  |*| 7 | (...) |*| 8 | R: When it comes to women being privileged at my work or in my life, it often results, as I already said earlier, from their physical construction. It is also often tiring that a woman cannot, so to say, in the jobs I do, move a roll of nonwoven fabric or a roll of something, some foil or a package that weighs some 25-30 kg. For this purpose, you need to take a man, who at this moment is doing something else. Of course, they feel disadvantaged since they interrupt their work, which they need to do and are paid for some unit. So with respect to this, there are some conflicts since often there is no possibility to compensate to these men the fact that they need to put it on, they need to cut it, they need to do this harder part of this physical work. And there is no way to do it since both women and men do physical jobs, and there is no possibility to compensate this in such a way that a woman would come and have to do something for the man since everywhere here this strength is required. Not many things can be fixed with smartness*| *|  or it cannot even be mechanized. It must simply be done.  |

Also here, the roles are written out. Maybe they are not written out in such a clear and lucid way, where it is enumerated what belongs to a father or a mother, wife, husband, but these spheres somehow clarify themselves. They position themselves. They have their own significance, their order and also in my house or in the upbringing of my children or in partner relationship with my wife, there is a position of a man and a woman unequivocally allocated. For instance, it has its simplest correlation to the fact that my wife is a pedagogist by education and both of my daughters, humanists by education, have never approached her asking for assistance or explanation in respect to the issues concerning maths, physics or chemistry. By assumption, these subjects were somehow mine. It was known that it was me who knows this stuff. Similarly to the thing which is the most natural and which requires maybe not men’s competence but some strength or knowledge of things that results from the fact that one does it often. I think about such household works, purely household works as, I don’t know, the blind broke, a tap is leaking, the internal part of the washing machine, the drum does not want to spin. Or suddenly, the pressure of oil in the car decreased. All this is addressed in a natural way to a man. Whereas, I don’t know, when I cannot find something or if there are no – it’s never the case in my house – clean shirts left or something else is missing, of course, these issues are addressed towards a woman, towards a wife.  |*| 3 | [*| *| ] |*| *|  |*| 5 | R: Well, precisely, here the situation was slightly different. Maybe it was because my mum was the only woman in the house, while there were four of us, men. Due to this, we had to be included in some household works. All the more that my mum always worked professionally. My father too, of course. So also us, we had to do some of such female, in inverted commas, things. There was no other possibility. Hence, we were included in such household works as cleaning windows, beating dust out of carpets or rugs, some*| *|  general cleaning or one of us was always on duty taking garbage out. This was something we had to do because this woman was not there. When my mum was there, she always, so to speak, supervised the whole thing but when she was coming back home from work, let’s say, at 4 pm, when we were still at school until more or less this time, she was not able to do all the things that normally a woman would do at home. So in this respect, our house was, had to be and was characterized by the roles that blended. And we had to agree to this, however with great resistance. [*| *| ] having three sons, my father always tried to exclude himself from this. And often he succeeded because since I remember, my father always used to be a director of some big enterprises. Due to this, he always had plenty of errands to run. And even if he did not have them, he used to say that he did. I don’t suspect him to lie, but his daily agenda was always so full, so when we were teens, then he always*| *|  because at that time, father delegated these chores to us more and more. And he was the one, who performed the leading role of the head of the family, but maybe not of a direct executor.  |*| 7 | R: Absolutely yes, but it results from some natural arrangement of the situation. The situation, in which I was the only man and besides me there, have been three, let’s say, women. First children, then older and older, but women. [*| *| ] My wife is not this type of a woman, who could take over some of these male responsibilities. She has always been a very sensitive person, who is easy to hurt, easy to*| *|  If someone said a bad word to her, she would later be sad for three days. So I have never tried to make her do some things, drive somewhere, talk to someone in a robust way. So one had to cope with all of this. So it was. Did I feel bad about it? Sometimes yes, sometimes no. That’s life.  |*| 8 | [*| *| ] |*| 9 | R: When we got married my wife did not work professionally for a very, very long time. Now, she runs such a small company so that she has something to do, some tasks of her own, some problems of her own. And she fulfills herself in this and she has something tiny, something of her own. I am the main recipient of her services, so she even has a person who will for sure make use of what she does. And what is extremely important, I pay her. Yes, I absolutely*| *|  [*| *| ]*| *|  this is a commercial thing. And that’s all. Wife is a wife, but for each thing, my wife*| *|  frankly speaking, I make myself a bill, but she gets remunerated. We think that this is such a healthy arrangement. She has her own money, which does not result from the fact that she was given it but she earned it. She earned it this way. And this has been working already for some longer time and it’s good.  |*| 10 | [*| *| ] |*| 11 | R: Well, life has put us - and still puts every and each of us - in such different situations that there were such situations, in which I would like very much someone else to drive somewhere instead of me, to do something, to perform this male part of life. On the other hand, I don’t know, whether I would be ready to take over this part of female life. [*| *| ] I mean, for sure there were situations, in which I felt privileged as a man, privileged that I do not have to, that I don’t have to take decisions in some situations and with regard to some issues, or even interfere. I felt this being privileged. At the same time, there have been situations, in which I know and feel that it is a conscious adoption of many responsibilities which in a different situation I would surely*| *|  or I would leave them, or force someone else to do it. But when it comes to my family, then I take it on.  |

And for instance, even if she wanted very much, some things she*| *|  |*| 2 | [*| *| ] |*| 3 | R:*| *|  She has to have some inhibitions because in the cultural part of this society, it is accepted so. And then one often thinks: well, it’s cool to be who you are. It was especially important in the period of school or studies or at the time, when it occurred on a daily basis.

[*| *| ] but not in the meaning of some abuse as an object but rather as a partner for some fight. Here, a woman had it better because she was always protected by her sex. [*| *| ] However, on the other hand, there is always this fear that due to the fact that she is yet this weaker person, it is so easy to hurt her, if she happens to come across someone like that.  |

So maybe [I will say something] with respect to this. Actually, the majority of sport referees are men. It is the same in basketball. We have admittedly a few female referees but still, so to speak, the moment when a woman referees, it is perceived to a great extent with some indulgence, right? After all, a man always enjoys some more respect on the court and a woman has to work harder to earn it with her decisions, her personality. I have such impression here that exactly the fact that I am a man had some influence on a greater acceptance among coaches, among players and generally spectators in this entire environment.  |*| *| ? |*| 3 | R: Yes, we start all the same. First, of course, everyone signs up for courses. You graduate from this course and start from the lowest age categories, from refereeing children’s games and then higher and higher. And this is exactly the same path.  |*| *| ? |*| 5 | R: I mean it is like this, let’s say, when we start and referee in one district, then with time girls seem to be perceived in the same way, right? If they have already worked hard for it with their personality. However, at the very beginnings, it is like this that coaches try to exert more pressure on women, because it is for them somehow.. it is their job, right? So exerting pressure on referees and [*| *| ] it is their profit. And still women seem to give the impression that you can exert more pressure on them. They approach men with greater, so to say, seriousness.  |*| 7 | R: For sure, this first*| *|  first, so to say*| *|  When I go out on the court, yes, greet the coaches, then after all when they see a man, they already approach*| *|  They assume some things, right? A man – he will keep discipline, no one will start to fight during the game, probably he knows the stuff, right? When they see a woman – will she manage, it is important competitions, strong players*| *|  does she know the rules well, will she be able to physically catch up? And this is*| *|  in the moment, when*| *|  It is mainly about the relationship between the coach and the referee, right? When coaches*| *|  but it’s the same with players. The players also approach men in a totally different way than they approach women. With women, it often happens that they approach them, as I said, indulgently, right? She makes a mistake – woman, yes? She has the right. And this, in a way, also makes women uncomfortable because they say: no, we are*| *|  we should be assessed in the same way. I got it wrong, my mistake, I am sorry. But not: she got it wrong, let it go.  |*| *| ? |*| 11 | R: On the one hand, they compete with men, but on the other, they have also some sort of their own path. The clearest example is that every year, in our district, name city district, there are four people who have a chance to advance and who go somewhere in Poland and get assessed. There is this, so to say, all-Poland rule that there are three people chosen from each district. It can be men, it can be women, it can be a mixed group. Plus one woman. [*| *| ] So always*| *|  yes. So this year for instance*| *|  This year for example, it happened like this that two girls and two boys from our district went, right? Because one girl was included in this three and the other one went, who, I think, would normally not go if there was a rule, for instance, that four people go. Admittedly, later during a normal, so to say, national selection, it happens already in a normal way. Everybody is thrown into the same basket and they are assessed, so there are no more privileges. I think it was five years ago, when a totally separate path for women was cancelled. Women used to go for the so-called camps, but with other women only. One chose, let’s say, three best women who advanced further. But it was already*| *|  they resigned from it and now everybody*| *|  a referee is a referee no matter whether it is a woman or a man.   |*| 12 | *** |*| *|  that they are treated this way? Or? |*| 14 | R: I think that it makes these first relationships more difficult. At the first instance, on the one hand, they are treated in a very indulgent way and this is often discouraging. And on the other hand, the coaches approach*| *|  the coaches and environment in general approach them with this attitude “she needs to be watched because you never know”, although she can be a very good referee. So it can be a factor that influences it. And there is one more additional issue, let say, maybe not in these youngest categories but later, there are also fans, many of them and this is*| *|  I think it can be discouraging for women. |*| 15 | *** |*| 17 | R: Or she was so good that no one noticed it.  |

So in this respect.  |*| 5 | R: It seems to me that taking the rubbish out is exactly one example. Also, not very often though, beating the dust of a carpet. Maybe some hoovering. For sure, nothing linked for example to cleaning windows. Maybe, the risk was too high that I would fall out with the window. What else? I think that*| *|  No, these are the most important ones. And of course, everyone had to take care of his/her room and his/her, so to say, toys. And when I am thinking about this upbringing maybe also the issue that*| *|  in some, already later period, when I was allowed*| *|  I don’t know, it is difficult to state whether it’s an issue of*| *|  but probably no, it’s not an issue of personality, but the question of me being a boy*| *| so I was allowed more. When I think about the time when my sister had this period of going out for eighteenth-birthday parties, it was always this 1 am time when the questions “where are you”, what and this and that, popped up. I already did not have this problem, meaning I did not have to come back at 1 am. Of course, the phone call was always recommended to inform that I will be back later or something but I could afford going out later and I have the impression that the fact that I was a boy and nothing bad should happen to me, could have actually had an influence on this.  |*| 7 | R: Yes, that’s what I actually also think can be significant, that*| *|  There is a party, so should a woman stay over at someone’s party? Well, she should rather not. And a boy, of course, whatever, let him stay, for example. I do think so. And it was probably mainly based on the fact that it is not seemly for a woman, that a young girl*| *|  And here a boy is always*| *|  maybe it was about it.  |

And I have to say that well, I can live by myself. It is not like this that I have to be with someone, though it is nicer with someone. But I also like living by myself. I like to travel alone. I like to walk somewhere alone. For instance, two years ago, I went for this longer travel to name country, to Asia in general, for a couple of months. Well, and there, I don’t know, whether in name country, they particularly notice white people. Supposedly, they look but for example, it did not bother me that I am a woman. If I can give such an example on the contrary*| *|  I travelled totally alone. First, I travelled with the trans-Siberian railway in a compartment with a young boy from name city, then with some young people from a hostel to a hostel. Practically everyone was of my son’s age, almost. I met really a few people of my age or a bit older. There, it totally did not count. I felt safe, I didn’t feel in danger. I mean, I avoided some clearly dangerous situations or districts; I would not find myself alone in some weird district at night. But I normally moved around name city and name city, various cities, various markets. Practically all the time, I travelled by trains alone and I totally did not feel there that I am a single woman on the road. There are also so many single women on the road. Now, the world has changed so much that*| *|  If I had a different family situation now, I would gladly go just by myself. Now, I am with a partner, so I will not go anywhere alone. We can go together. But if I didn’t have anyone stable, a permanent partner, if I were alone, then I would gladly go even for a couple of years. To many different places.  |*| 2 | *** |*| *|  because you are saying that you felt safe during this travel. Have you ever had any situations, let’s say, here in Poland, when you experienced violence of some kind for instance, psychological or physical, due to the fact that you are a woman? |*| *|  psychological not physical. But it is difficult to talk about it because it never comes just from one side. It is always some kind of  arrangement and let’s say, I don’t know, whether it happened because I was a woman or I was economically weaker or I simply have a rather firm character and I do not let others step in. So it also causes aggression in such weaker partners. I think that simply*| *| *|  that I though that it was such a point in time that I could afford it financially and that I was alone so had no obligations. My son was adult, so I could simply go away. And I did. [*| *| *| *|  One did not talk about harassment at that time but it was a form of harassment. For instance, a guy who addresses a woman by “sweetheart” is simply a loser for me from the start. I mean, I did not allow to be called like this, but*| *|   |*| *|  |*| 6 | R: But of course, instantly, yes. I mean this was a man, who*| *|  An older man, older than me and at that time already quite*| *|  an older man before retirement. And he addressed people, women like this. However, after this first time, he has never addressed me like this any more. He did it once but I got so upset and reacted so sharply that later he has never addressed me this way any more. Then, it turned out that he was all in all a very nice guy, but he just had this style. But it was already a couple of years ago. At that time in Poland, the topic of harassment did not exist.  |*| 8 | R: Well, like women; women usually giggle or laugh or even I they have something against it, they will not speak it out. Besides, he was at the managerial position. All women were practically subject to him. There were no women there on equivalent posts. No, there were not because even the accountant was a man, the chief accountant. So professionally, he was simply on a much higher position than these girls who worked in bookkeeping or some other, I don’t know, various departments.  |*| *|  |*| 10 | R: Well, no, no, no.  |*| 12 | R: Maybe, it did not even bother them. Because I have also noticed that many women it does not even bother at all. I don’t know, simply it does not bother them. It bothers me and I don’t allow [*| *| ]. |*| 14 | R: Yes, it stopped from his side. Yes, sometimes he even joked and pretended to bite his tongue, but no, no, no. No, later it was OK.  |*| 15 | *** |*| 16 | R: I also see a big difference*| *|  I see how these young girls are completely not ashamed of their corporality. Whereas when I was, I don’t know, in primary school or secondary school, then girls who developed faster, had breasts for instance and so on, they were ashamed. They were hiding it and so on. Now, there is completely no such problem. Neither in Poland. These young girls walk around nearly naked and they are totally not*| *|  at least the ones who look OK*| *|  ashamed of their own body. They even dazzle a bit. However for me*| *|  no, it was different, but not even in terms of morality but this maturing; this maturing looked different. A woman in Poland, a girl when she was becoming a woman was after all a bit ashamed of it and she somehow used to withdraw a bit. Whereas now, absolutely no, everything is just like on a tray. [*| *| ] So in this respect – presenting oneself – there’s indeed a huge change. I remember that I was not allowed to wear thin tights in primary school. It was simply not acceptable for a girl to wear thin tights in primary school and one had to wear these thick ones. And you had to fight with your mum about the thin ones. And finally, you could win it. But no high heels, no make-up, no painted nails; it was out of question. And now, girls start putting on make-up already in the 5th/6th grade.  |

It was a long time ago, it was 26 years ago. And at that time co-habiting, I was not a married woman then*| *|  I think that co-habiting in Poland at that time was rather not common, but it did not raise any special emotions among people, like it is now. For some period of time and in some circles now in name city. And I think that it was such*| *|  all in all, a very important moment in life, giving birth to a child and so on. And I remember such a funny story when I was giving birth to him in the hospital in name district in name city,  to my son and I had no health certificate because I was not employed on a contract but did freelance work and I did not have a husband and these nurses who registered me reacted to me in a very weird way since practically*| *|  I don’t know if you’re not going to cut it out – but practically only prostitutes were giving birth to babies without husbands. [*| *| ] So they looked at me and*| *|  And this was such a funny situation. And then in principle, my whole career path was subordinated to the fact that the baby needs to be brought up. So I resigned from various lucrative jobs. I remember, I had one very good job in a newly-established newspaper but I had to leave work around 3 pm in order to get to the day-care room around 4 pm since my son became in the meantime a 6 or 7-year old and attended kindergarten. So in this respect, the fact that I was a woman*| *|  and then I was in a stable relationship and we could have shared this childcare, but as everybody knows, a man works longer because he earns more and so on, so*| *|  At least, this was my case. After all, in each relationship, I was always in  the role of a person, who is stereotypically a woman, so she earns less, works less and takes care of the household and children.  |*| 4 | R: Well, good. I mean, there have been such moments when I worked a lot, but still I was always the person who had to finish work earlier to pick up a child from school. However in the mornings, we shared. Let’s say, my husband was driving [my son] to school and then I had to go [to pick him up]. It was onerous, but so onerous*| *| *|  for sure I played some female role in my son’s life.  |*| *|  |*| 6 | R: I think so. I think so because my mother was a rather independent woman. She was also married and gave birth to two children and she worked all her life. My father worked too, but my mother was not such a typical woman of these times since she often used to say that for instance marriage is not the best option for a woman. She simply had some sort of feminist views, which I later took over. I had a very*| *|  very feminist attitude at some period of my life and then it passed a bit. I think it happened also as a result of the clash with reality, which in Poland is rather difficult for single women.  |*| 7 | [*| *| ] |*| 9 | R: I mean I had such*| *|  They clashed*| *|  it means*| *|  First, I thought that I will just be a totally independent woman. Since I have education, I will be independent, I will earn my living, I will give birth to a child. When my child was born in a free relationship, I was with his father, we lived together but I even wanted the child to have my name. And I had some sort of*| *|  I read a lot in German at this time and in Germany, feminism was very vivid at this moment. Well, I wanted to be totally independent, I wanted to even raise this child by myself. This relationship fell apart after all and then this clash with reality happened, that there is either or. Well, either you work and earn a lot of money, or you raise a child. The fact that living without a man is not that much fun because you have no support and I noticed that after all, I have so many female features that I want to be with a man, that I want to have some support and be able to rely on someone and so on. And when I was raising my child, these feminist views faded away quite quickly. Because when a single woman raises a son, it never ends up well. It simply does not work out well. A boy has to have a father or some sort of a substitute of a father. This is why I think my motherhood mainly influenced the fact that I changed these views.  |*| 10 | *** |*| *|  since at the beginning you said about partner relationships that in this respect, it was different in the past and now it’s different. Could you tell me something about it? |*| 12 | R: I mean I think that when I studied, few women lived with their men without being married. Maybe it was due to the fact that apartments were not available at that time. However, if a woman already lived like this, then it really stirred no sensation. It did not cause a sensation. And then there came such a moment in Poland that suddenly this traditional morals of ours came very much*| *|  I mean in big cities, because I don’t know how it was at the countryside because I have never lived there. But this traditional morals came to the fore and at some point in time*| *|  |*| 14 | R: It was when my son was already at school, let’s say, primary school, so he was born in 1984 and these were the 90’s or  a bit later*| *|  |*| 16 | R: When*| *|  yes. When Poland horribly regressed. In my opinion, it horribly regressed. And I have noticed that many young women, who generally are not religious and nothing of this kind, they have church weddings and so on. There is such a strong pressure. And I think it goes in two directions since on the one hand, there is this traditionalism, and on the other hand, still a lot of women live without being married, get divorced and have children without getting married. So, in these big cities, which I know from my own experience, it is practically no sensation. But women themselves seem to regress, not the circumstances. It looks like the society or, let’s say, families or some people who know about it, accept it in some way or nobody really cares about it any more. Whereas the women, these young girls are in my view very backward nowadays. And they have a very traditionalist approach. They want to have these church weddings, I don’t know, they take care about*| *|  babies*| *|  I mean, if there is a baby, if there’s a pregnancy, there is a wedding and so on. In fact, it is something totally strange to me*| *|  strange, strange, strange. And I think that in this respect, Poland is much different even from the neighboring western countries, Czech Republic, or others. It is somehow very traditional in Poland.  |*| *|  lasts?  |*| 18 | R: No, it lasts. In my opinion, it lasts.  |*| *|  |*| 20 | R: No, no, no. |

Although I do not make any effort*| *|  It is like this*| *|  right that there are such women, who are always visible and I belong to these visible women. |*| 4 | R: It makes it easier. Absolutely, it does. |*| 6 | R: Yes, yes. Everywhere, I am sort of promoted for the first place. I am promoted. But it’s only now when I see it. Sometimes, it disturbed me in life. As for boys, when we were young, there were not too many of them around me. I mean there were some, but they were not dating me or something. And now they are telling me “because you were such a lady”. Lady? Where? With this sport and all this. No, but I was judged this way. However, it helps me now.  |*| 8 | R: The way I behave demands respect. Especially from men. It requires respect.

As a matter of fact, I tell everybody about it. I am not one of these who would drag some loads. I say: “Could you help me please?”. And it works out in a totally normal way. And as some tell me, it’s not a request. It’s not a request and it is impossible not to do and they do it in such a kind and nice way. And I have never humiliated anyone. Never. And now, it helps a lot. And here, I believe that my femininity is a very, very good thing. |*| 9 | ***  |*| 10 | R: [*| *| ] For sure, each woman who is in some sense – I believe so because it happened to me – representative (if she’s additionally young), well-shaped*| *|  [*| *| ] who is visible, who can show, present herself, which is very often totally not dependent on her [*| *| ] And it helps a lot.

I am visible and I do not know why but they surround me with respect. Men always look at me with some distant admiration. What for? And I do not really feel like it. But now I just use it. I make use of it. In small things. And upbringing at home is also very significant for women. [*| *| ] What I mean is building this femininity. Creating this femininity. And this is what my father did in respect to all of us. He sat in his armchair with a walking stick in his hand, since I only know him this way because when he lost his leg, I was 2 years old.

So very early in my life, I started*| *|  I was doing whatever possible. I practiced figure skating. Until today, I am a passionate skier. [*| *| ] I used to swim professionally. I professionally practiced swimming for 13 years. I swam for the representation of Poland. I swam  on the national team. Some silly stuff like this. And I swam some idiotic style – butterfly. What else? Everything: I practiced high jump, played basketball, volleyball, but I was hopeless in volleyball. And I used to do all these things. In the meantime, I had to take care of the house and I had to take care of the house in a very serious and responsible way, like a woman.  |*| 3 | R: Because everything in the household belonged to me [she means all the chores]. Simply everything.  |*| *| ] |*| 5 | R: In my parents’ house. Because my mum died very early. For a year, my mum was dying at home from cancer, so this was a nightmare. And in 1939, on the 3rd day of the war, September 3, my father lost his leg. He was on his way to the regiment and then he was on crutches. On crutches and used a walking stick. But until the end of his life, he worked and he supported the household afterwards, after the war. My mum died in 1954, so it was very long time ago. I had two younger sisters, a father without a leg, who worked, my sport, school. Good that I learned, surprise, surprise. No one knows when. And I had to remember about everything. Big apartment*| *|  Oh, and there was a very big poverty after the war. After the war, there was a horrible poverty since absolutely everything that we had got lost during the war and [we had] only what my father earned. So, you get up in the morning, you think that one has no*| *|  her sandals*| *|  or a strap is ripped off and I need to sew it. The other needs her collar to be replaced. You need to prepare a sandwich for the father, make a breakfast for him. And for myself. And then to school and laundry. I remember, doing laundry was a nightmare. Four floors, coal up to the laundry room since it was these pre-war block of flats. Actually, it was a beautiful, big apartment. The apartment had to be cleaned. How I managed to do it all, I simply do not know. But I did.  |*| *|  |*| 7 | R: It’s difficult for me to define it now, however when my mum was still alive*| *|  when my mum was still alive, when my grandma was still alive*| *|  I am of the old school and one believed that a woman is responsible for the household. A man is supposed to provide money for this household. My mother never worked since my father considered it demeaning that a woman would have to go to work. It was unthinkable. And so it was.  And besides, the situation forced me to do it.  |*| 8 | *** |*| 10 | R: In my own house*| *|  |*| *|  |*| 12 | R: Had an effect on my own household. My home with my husband was*| *|  it was a very good home. Very good home. I took care of the household. Home existed*| *|  home was created by me. But it was created by me for him. He was the head of the house*| *|  no, I put it wrongly. Everything was done in order to make him feel fine and happy. He tried to help me with everything, but not always it worked out for him. Sometimes, this non-technicality of his was tiring. Still, I have never done anything -  I thought it should be like this – that he could be unhappy with. The door of the house was never closed. Since my husband*| *|  they always said that he was an institution, not a man. He had a great knowledge and big community conviction. He had lots of friends all around the world. One day, I set the table 17 times; so many times the guests appeared. They were there all the time. I had enough of it. And now it’s a mortuary since rarely someone comes to visit, very rarely. After his death, somehow this house ceased to exist. It means, he was there and that’s why the home existed. And this house was created by me. From the beginning to the end. And there was everything in the house. He was able to invite people in at 23h00-24h00 at night. “Name respondent, you know, we are sitting here in the library and still working on something, we are hungry, prepare some supper for us”. “And how many of you are there?”,  “Six”. And they used to come at 24h00 at night and I used to prepare a hot meal for all six of them since I always had everything done.  |*| 13 | *** |*| *|  |*| 15 | R: Always and I always worked. I always worked and I worked a lot. And since my husband was*| *|  after all a university professor so he was very knowledgeable, but so what, he used to give money away. He had no clue about the value of money. There was nothing like my money and your money in our house; there was just money, if there was not enough, there was not enough. And I took care so it was there. I took care about it. And since God punished me in a way – it’s God’s punishment  - I will do everything. I can do even the things about which I do not know that I can do. For real. |*| 17 | R: Always, always. |*| 19 | R: No and until today no work is a burden to me.  |

I guess everybody knows that girls dream about being models and boys not that much. As a matter of fact, men when they are models, they do it just to earn money for some music equipment or studies or to realize some other passion of theirs. That’s why they are models, not to fulfill themselves in this profession. |*| *|  they do it for a different reason, right? |*| 10 | R: Yes, yes, yes.  |*| 12 | R: Why? Since it’s interesting.

That they’re gay, for sure some kind of homo or metrosexual that they want to work so much on their own bodies, that they take so much care about themselves, and are so ooh and aah. There are guys are like this who idolize themselves but they are exceptions.  |*| 18 | *** |*| 19 | R: Everybody knows that when you’re standing behind the bar, men if they are drunk, they are more pushy and they have these stupid comments, some sort of pick-up or something; they try to start talking to you. And one knows that if a girl is drunk, she is not going to approach the bartender the same way as a drunk guy approaches a barmaid, right? And one knows that it is somehow more difficult to handle. However, I actually had no problem with this because I am quite assertive. But it is like it is. That it is somehow unpleasant. |*| 20 | *** |*| *|  how to put it*| *|  concerning your upbringing, have you ever noticed any situations in which the fact that you are a girl played some significant*| *|  some role? You’ve got some comparison between the upbringing of a brother and sister by the same parents. |*| 22 | R: I rather think that it was not the factor that had some influence but it was more due to the time, when we were raised.  |*| 24 | R: Because it is a big difference, 10 years, so*| *|  And name brother was the first child, I was the second, so I had it easier, you know, name brother had already blazed a trail. So I was allowed to go out to the parties earlier, I started living by myself earlier, I got my own car earlier. But this is simply because of the fact that times have changed and also my parents became ready for this in some way. [*| *| ] And I also think that I am more responsible.  |*| 25 | *** |*| 27 | R: When I had already won this competition [top model competition] and I was supposed to sign the contract and my parents hesitated whether to sign it or not*| *|  |*| 29 | R: I was 15. And it was my parents who had to sign this contract and my mum talked to her friends, who said that she had no right to take it away from me because it is God’s gift. So why should she take it away from me, right? Because on the other hand, when name brother had a chance to play basketball when we were in name country, my mother did not let him. Just like this, no one knows why but she did not. And he was more or less the same age since he was 13 at that point.

Some girls explain to themselves that it is the case since they are attractive, some other consider it loutishness, yes? I think the latter. And this is it.  |

Namely, it has been easier for me. At my university, I study at ASP [the Academy of Fine Arts], it is girls, who have it much easier. And if they are pretty, then I can do nothing at all, I can have my work done at the last moment or not come to the corrections at all, or attend classes just once per month*| *|  and it’s easy since professors are men. Women do not teach at our faculty at all, so*| *|  we have it considerably easier than guys.  |*| 3 |   |*| 4 | R: At my faculty, actually yes. At the graphic art faculty, there is just one and I am not in her group, so there are men only. For instance, for one course, I need to have a couple of printouts done. I do not have anything and I get 5 [“very good” grade], whereas my male friends have their printouts and get 3 [“satisfactory” grade]. And everybody knows that I will dress more nicely for classes [laugh] and it’s cool.   |*| 6 | R: We are sorry that [laugh] it is worse for them, but so what? I am not going to get my grade lower, right? |*| 7 | *** |*| *|  wait, let’s get deeper into the topic of the university since it’s interesting.

They say: “name respondent, you’ve got it easier because you don’t have to do anything”. And here, girls also do not have to do anything and it’s cool with this professor, everybody knows it.  |*| 21 | R: Yes.  |*| 23 | R: Yes, but what should they do. There are not going to rebel against a professor, right? Since it seems to be some kind of a taboo*| *| that it’s not really like this, when it is like it is.

Not really. I do not think so because I simply have such skills as I have and these skills are somehow suitable for this. There was no competition in the form of women, which resulted from the reasons*| *|  that did not depend on me and neither on other people. It just worked out like this that they were recruiting. When it comes first to the traineeship here and then my transfer to work, it was mainly skills that played a role.  |*| 2 | *** |*| *| ] and how about the sphere of some hobbies, for instance? |*| 4 | R: Hmmm, it means*| *| ? You mean discrimination in the sphere of hobbies? |*| 6 | R: Really? OK [ironically].

Generally, for guys*| *|  and at least it’s like this in my case, I don’t know if it’s the case of all men*| *|  but I like competition, so the sphere of politics is of great interest to me. And it influenced my hobby, I mean krav-maga, maybe actually a bit more. However, there have been girls among us; though there have been significantly less of them. But it results from the fact that men are interested in such things of their own accord, I guess. As if girls*| *|  they were of course interested in this krav-maga but not to such an extent as guys. Men liked it because they always wanted to be the best in what they do, so*| *|  |*| 10 | R: No. I observed that there was nothing like this. Girls just wanted to be able to defend themselves. |*| 11 | *** |*| 13 | R: Oh yes, for sure!

So, how I could say this, I was always supposed to be a man, right? [*| *| ] |*| 15 | R: Yes, I knew it. I loused myself into a trap. I was supposed to be a man that is a human being, who at least tries to have more of a grasp over what is happening around him, right?

At least drive a car well. All these things had some influence of some sort. However, of course one cannot let oneself go crazy, so I abstained a bit from it all. As everybody knows, there are a lot of things that are considered*| *|  I don’t know. Not to whine, yes? Not to cry. Not to experience each loss in a way that would be too big.

Frankly speaking, sometimes, it actually seemed that it was worse for some men during philosophy studies. Because everybody knows, girls will smile a bit and male lecturers will usually regard them more favorably. And when it comes to guys, they [lecturers] always asked about some heavier things and besides, smiling to them was somehow not nicely perecieved. At least this was the case at my university. |*| 2 | *** |*| 3 | [On fixing stuff in various offices] |*| 4 | R: If there are women there, it is sometimes very easy to wrap them around your finger. And since I am a man, then it’s just a couple of smiles, some twaddle, [*| *| ] and usually something works out. At the academia maybe as well, but rather with administrative stuff. Maybe it works somehow. But you can also interpret it a bit as a result of the approach of a particular person, not his/her sex. In other words, if you come smiling, somehow generally open and throw some jokes on the side*| *|  I have never confronted it with the other sex [women], whether it is the same for them or not. Everybody knows that sometimes*| *|  sometimes.. here, at work for instance, it is similar. When it comes to women, it is easier. I mean it is easier for me to talk to women.  |*| 5 | *** |*| 6 | R: So*| *|  What other situations are there in life? Surely, on the road, right? When you drive, generally a woman behind a wheel is something that is always considered to be*| *|  often you do not let them go, right? However, I am a gentleman and I like letting women go when they already drive their cars somewhere and want for instance to join in the traffic. But sometimes, it happens that*| *|  one can see it on the roads, right? |*| 8 | R: What do I think about female drivers? Does it really matter whether you are a women or a man? It’s important if one can drive. There is a whole bunch of male idiots. There is a societal pressure on a man to drive a car fast and this is a bit negative for us, as for men, I reckon, because men who drive in a relaxed way, let’s say, fast too, but simply do not struggle too much, are sometimes considered, I don’t know, worse drivers, which is in fact not true. But it seems to me that this also depends on the age, maybe some education, knowledge about the world, how you think about such issues.  |

I did*| *|  I was a project manager. I sat voluntarily on the management boards of various non-governmental organizations, so automatically, when I graduated, I was offered a position of a director, let’s say, of some eastern project in one of the Polish NGOs. And the issue that I was 25 at that time and became a director of some program in an NGO and I had a title “director” printed on my business card very often met with a very big astonishment*| *|  However*| *|  |*| 3 | R: For instance, how it is possible, how come that you can become a director at the age of 25, right? Whereas somehow my male colleagues of the same age and on the same positions have never received such comments, right? So in my opinion, these comments automatically included some kind of an implied meaning: how such a young chit, excuse me, who just graduated, jumped to such a post. It was not, so to say, sexually neutral. [*| *| ] So I think that each time being in this kind of organizations*| *|  taking positions that are by nature managerial, is linked to the fact that women are perceived more as a square peg in the round hole, not a person who in fact takes decisions. And there’s a greater expectation that a person who is going to manage it all, is a man. And if it is a woman, then in some way her position is instantly being questioned, I think.  |*| 4 | *** |*| 5 | R: [*| *| ] a woman in Poland is supposed to be a wife, a mother and if she works, it’s cool but her position should not be the one that makes her husband’s or partner’s position seem worse than the one she has. And there is a sort of expectation that it should be your main function in the society that you should perform. You should be a wife and you should be a mother, that’s it. And if you happen to have some leadership aspirations, you are a manager, you’re automatically treated as some ruthless harpy that for sure has not a whit of warmth in herself and due to that she has some complexes that made her reach the place where she is now and not any other. And she surely has no family, certainly no husband and for sure she is not going to have it as it is her main*| *|  this career is her main determinant, her main sense of life. And I think that this is a very negative picture of a woman, who achieves success in Poland. It is not linked to something that you perceive positively, but*| *|  |*| 6 | *** |*| 7 | R: [*| *| ] For me it has always been a surprise because I grew up in a family where a man and a woman are equal and where my parents are partners. And somehow the situation, in which someone questions my qualifications for a given post due to my gender, was a totally new situation to me as I was raised in an environment, in which it is your qualifications, what you have to say or present that counts and not the fact that you are woman or a man.  |*| 8 | *** |*| 9 | R: [*| *| ] on the surface, this is changing. However, in reality these patterns, some kind of “calques” or models that the majority of us brings, no matter what, from our own environments, are very strong. And I would say that still this model, among some of my female and male friends that I met studying or even, let’s say, working, is that a woman should be this weaker party. Even if she has some professional aspirations, they should not surpass what her partner does. And this is very strong, which is worrying. And despite everything, young people still have this kind of approach.  |*| 11 | R: “On the surface” means that while having a general look or within some kind of a shallow conversation, many people admit that of course it is important that women*| *|  that it is normal that there is equality, that women have the same aspirations, that they are directors, etc. However, if we take a closer look to see what patterns do in fact govern their life and what expectations they have, we see that it is not true. That they sort of transfer some social expectations from their environments and even do not realize that they behave this way. |*| 12 | *** |*| 13 | R: Paradoxically, I would say that looking at my female and male friends, it seems to me that men have much more*| *|  they are more and more able to understand the situation that women became equal to them. Young men; I am talking now about young men. [*| *| ] However, I think that there is this group of women, who – I don’t know whether it is linked to what they took out from their home or some internal pressure that they have – theoretically state that it is OK, yes sure, let’s have careers and all is great, but in practice the thing that is still determining for them is whether they have a husband and children.  |*| 14 | *** |*| 15 | R: [*| *| ] When it comes to higher-ranked posts then despite everything women have not been earlier treated and promoted on a par with men so the power in some way belonged more to the men. And the fact that women became more thriving, dynamic, more interested in improving their skills and more motivated is*| *|  was for them some kind of a novelty or shock, right? And sometimes, I had a chance to experience this approach: “OK, you’re great, you speak 10 languages and you’ve got your PhD and you’re awesome, but you have to realize your biological limitations. You have to realize that at some point in time you will be out of the market because you’re going to have babies and you’re going to have this and that”. This is the approach of older men. Maybe it is related to some experiences that they have and that these younger men have still not acquired, so they do not see it in these categories. [*| *| ] So in some way, they undermine your position as a woman by saying that you’re not a rightful one as you don’t have a husband and children, right? And this is so very Polish, I would say, as surely no one will point it out to you abroad.  |

So it was like a civil defense contest which I won and because of that my teacher was obliged to give me a mark of two grades higher than the one he had wanted to give to me. So he was sort of bound to give me the grade 5 [very good] as my final grade for the school year, which hurt him a lot as he had to give me a higher grade.

[*| *| ] We were a kind of, I would say, local attraction - the fact that we perform. However, nobody has ever treated us in a way that made us feel that it was something not right [Polish context]. |*| 9 | *** |*| 10 | R: Whenever you are in a situation when you are sitting with some guys and you say that you shoot, then the whole attitude of men towards you gets totally different.

And I repeatedly had a chance to experience this with regard to shooting or sailing or some sports that after all*| *|  [*| *| ] I have a certificate of a lifeguard and in the same way, due to the fact that you’re a lifeguard, men seem to change their attitude towards you.   |

And where was that? With our neighbors. We had, we lived in a 2-under-one-roof type of house. We had a friendly relationship with them but nothing more. We were not intensely involved in their lives. We didn’t come and visit each other. They had 2 daughters, but we saw those children often. So, to cut a long story short: at a certain point*| *|  oh, yes, my wife if very sensitive. She is not a clairvoyant, but is very sensitive to people. So she can just look at you and then she will know you. You have to look into the eyes, she says. Whether you are sad or not*| *|  And people who have been sexually abused, she picks them out straight away. So, because it influences your life so much. Well, at a certain point we started to think that it was the case with the neighbors. Because we had the neighbors’ girl*| *|  And she always told a lot of fantasy stories, and I thought they were very strange. So, finally, she would come and visit us once in a while, so would come*| *|  and tell strange stories or call with her social service or something. At a certain point my wife just asked her. That was in ’87 I think, just before I did my Phd. So, she told us her story. She already lived elsewhere at that point, but still close by. Then we have 10 or 12 years, we have helped her quite intensely, we have accepted her more or less as our adopted daughter. We tried to find out all we could about sexual abuse. My wife also wrote a book at that time about sexual abuse in the church context. Well, this really demanded a lot of our energy. I wrote a diary about it, it is still there on the computer, I think it is 70 pages with everything that we went through. So this affair was very heavy and the abuse was horrible. As a child she was also sold into prostitution. The worst part is that you cannot take this to court because if you have been abused since the age of 4, you are so shattered, that you are no longer able to take it to court. Finally she was so psychologically disturbed that we had to cut our contact with her as well, about 12 years ago. I think now*| *|  how long ago would that have been? Yes, 2002 I think. Something like 10 years. Why did we break our contact with her? Yes, at a certain point she started to tell stories*| *|  look, it is important in such a relationship to have trust in each other. She should be able to trust us completely. But it turned out that she told stories that were manifestly untrue. Yes, and if this is about blaming people*| *|  it becomes very difficult. So, at a certain moment we said: ‘we cannot go on like this anymore’.  |

But that was always mainly because of the social network, the social feeling, the social context, that is important. We are now members of a church in Amsterdam but religion itself*| *|  The religious ideologies, we renounce. So, basically we are humanists and we even question the role that the church has played. Not so much in gender aspects. Anyway, the church that we belong to, they also have homosexuals, lesbians, everybody is welcome. But I do have the impression that in general, the church has had a very negative impact. You see, the more orthodox a church is, the more it will attach itself to stories that it takes for granted, and if you*| *|  So, you see the same thing with Muslims. I studied the Koran a bit and immediately you see similarities with the bible. Of course you are dealing with an old book as well and if you take those stories literally, then where does that lead to? Nowhere of course! This is something that you have much less with the protestants:  the role of authority. That is much less important. So everybody decides for himself or herself what they want. So I don’t think in that sense religion is*| *|  it definitely does not play a good role!  |*| 4 | R: Sexual abuse as well! Because very many women – my wife also wrote that in her book –*| *|  they play a negative role. Because yes, the patriarchal structure, that is very obvious. The abusers can very often defend themselves with*| *|  we are all sinners right? So that is also negative. So, I don’t see a positive role for the church. Now, they have reluctantly done something, to write something about it. Also from the protestants side. So I expect a lot more from humanism. And I think that religions*| *|  yes, you can admire them, but I only see disadvantages in them. I also think sometimes: ‘If I would not have been raised religiously, I would have liked that more.’ Although I still do go to the church from time to time. Not because I think the church services are so important, but just to meet the people. So I have a bit of a religious trauma. Does it show?  |

I do think that it changes over time, but surely not as much as TV suggests. You should pay attention next time when you watch a series or a movie and there is something about sex, I think*| *|  in 90 to 95% of the cases it is the woman who takes the initiative. You should pay attention, it is systematically done like that. And this is a big lie. But why do we all keep this lie alive? That has very much to do with gender. It is because men would like the world to be that way. Men want more sex than women, so they fantasize a world in which every women is eager to have sex with them, so they make movies that show such a world.  |*| 4 | R: It is so stereotypical, just look around you. It makes me think: ‘Why doesn’t anybody notice this? Very strange. But what sort of a view is propagated this way and what are the consequences? Obviously it influences women, because they start to think that it is supposed to be that way: ‘ That is how it should be. That is how I should act. And if I don’t feel those feelings or like it, than there is something wrong with me.’ I still get surprised about it.  |*| 6 | R: You are entitled to it! |*| 7 | R: No, the same thing is also apparent in literature. You should take any ordinary book, a thriller or something. Or a detective wherein sex is an issue. Then you read the same thing. And that is so bad because the book will not be about sex, it is just an accessory to the story, but it shows exactly the same thing.  |

Those two female friends lived together. Most likely those two friends were a lesbian couple, but that was just never spoken of.  |*| 6 | R: I do know, when I was a student, that aspect started to surface. I remember in those days reading a booklet  - it must have been ’65 or something – written by two priests. They had written a booklet: ‘we are also homosexual’. So, then we already got to think: well, yes, homosexuality. It is not something that you grow into, it is something in your genes. We very quickly accepted that opinion. But the strange thing is, that we have a very big family and we don’t have that in our family.  |

But anyway, I didn’t like the idea. My wife liked the idea, so my opinion did not count anymore.*| *|  So one of my daughters wanted to learn ballet and the other was more*| *|  She played tennis. They both played tennis. Not that they were very good at it, but they played fairly well. And so one of my daughters wanted to do ballet. So, she joined a ballet group in our village, but at  a certain moment she wanted to move ahead in this and then she had to take lessons in town D who had special ballet courses and that was very heavy. So apart from going to secondary school, she also had to take 2 hours of ballet lessons 5 days a week in town D. So that was pretty much! I was opposed to her doing that. I said: ‘listen, you don’t have the body to do that. Listen, now you are still*| *|  young and pretty and slim. But if I look around in our family, this will not stay like that. And you know what is really important if you want to do ballet: you need to be very skinny and you are not skinny, so I would quit.’ ‘Yes, but there is also jazz ballet, etc’. So the teacher she had in our village supported the idea and said: ‘You should support your child!’ and also my wife said: ‘Yes, we should do it!’ So, I declined and we went ahead. Now in retrospect we often wonder whether that was a good decision, because it caused quit some things. So, when we ask her now: ‘Should we have taken a different decision?’. She is till struggling with Bulimia. Do you know that? Anorexia, Bulimia? No anorexia, but bulimia, an eating disorder. In all the TV shows that I have ever seen, nobody places a link with ballet and I think it would be ok to do so. Because there definitely is a link between the two. Because in a classic ballet training*| *|  yes, you need to be skinny, so*| *|  But also here my opinion was not listened to.*| *|  |*| 4 | R: I think so, I really think so. Look, there are different types of ballet. If it is jazzballet, it becomes less important. And although they don’t say this explicitly, it is always obvious that the skinniest girls and the most beautiful girls, got the most attention during the training. She really could feel that. And look, she was not the most beautiful or the skinniest, but she was very intelligent, so she could hang on because she could learn the exercises very easily. So that is how she managed but if this was ok for her development? We’re not sure! |*| 5 |*| *|  |*| 9 | R: I think it is less important for the men. Obviously they should not be fat, but still. I think that the demands are lower, lighter.  |

Afterwards I still did my military service in Amsterdam and then we moved to town A. I went to work there at the technical university. I worked there for 20 years. Here we get to the first point I want to make about gender. When I finished my studies, it was a favorable period to look for jobs. I could get a lot of different jobs. I solicited for several jobs and in fact could chose what I wanted to do.  |*| 4 | R: I had graduated in mathematics, masters in mathematics, but I also had started to work on IT during my military service. Afterwards I chose to go to B. Because I thought: it is very spacious to live there. ‘Living where there is room’ said the billboards in those days.  |*| 6 | R: Yes, in those days it was still the technical college, but later on became the technical university. The technical university was new, was modern they had lots of facilities. It was the landmark of the region. So that sounded like fun to me. However, my wife did not like it at all. She did not want to go there. She would have preferred me to go to town C because she liked that more. She did not want to go to B. But, the husband was the boss, the profession*| *|  It was not that she had concrete reasons for not going there, it was more an emotional resistance. She thought the place was too*| *|  yes, provincial, traditional. No, she didn’t want to.*| *|  Anyway, so we ended up in town B.  |*| 8 | R: Yes, but that doesn’t mean that she didn’t get involved straight away.  |*| 9 |*| *|  |*| 10 | R: So, we get to an important point in my story. Something that played a big role, what my wife wanted at the time. The point is – when we talk about gender – in those days it was normal – we got married in 1966 – you got married, you started a family, your husband had a good job, so you quit your job. That was true. |*| 12 | R: No, when I met my wife, she already worked as a teacher in Amsterdam. |*| 14 | R: Yes, a diploma. So she had finished those studies. While we were still living in Amsterdam, she worked as a teacher, but when we moved out to the town B; she stopped working. But she was very occupied at the time with three small children. One, there was two years between them (the respondent had a son and two years later 2 twin daughters), so in two years time she had 3 children. That was very busy. Nowadays you would say; yes, hold on, but in those days that was normal. So, she did a lot of things besides running the household to develop herself. For example, she quickly started an Amnesty International group in which she is still involved today. She got involved in the church, teached the small children there, telling stories. She got all that started. Some things that we had taken over from Amsterdam. The church was our village, not too traditional ,so that was ok.  |*| 15 | R: I lost the story now, where was I heading? |*| 17 | R: In those days yes, but it wasn’t easy to say*| *|  well, sometimes they would work together to resist me. Because look, at a certain point, my son said: ‘I want to go and study IT. Well, we had a university just around the corner. But he wanted to go to Amsterdam. His mother supported him in this decision. So whatever I did – not that I would do anything terrible – he had to go to Amsterdam. So he did it! When he was 17 he left for Amsterdam. |*| 19 | R: Yes, in those days that was it. Especially moving to that village was a very sensitive point. That is what she says now: ‘I really did not want to, but I just did it’. That was normal, she could not influence that choice. She would have preferred me to go to town C, not because that town interested her, but because that was closer to Amsterdam.  |*| 21 | R: Yes, but I think*| *|  it was just a feeling you know: ’Everything will work out in that village’.  |*| 23 | R: Yes. |

It is more because students have to tell their often very personal stories, personal problem to the student-dean and they should have the possibility to talk to a man if they would prefer that. Just as much as there would be students who prefer to talk to a women, there are students who prefer to talk to a man. So that was the context. |*| 6 | R: The management of the faculty. And I was told, but this is dubious, that it is not sure if this is allowed according to the Dutch law? But I don’t know about that. Anyway, it was there in the job offer. And I took advantage of it.  |*| 7 |*| *|  |*| ¾*|  women and*| ¼*|  men among the students. What about the staff? Do you have an idea on how they are divided? |*| 11 | R: Also more women. |*| 15 | R: No, no, but it has increased, an improvement.  |*| 17 | R: well, the atmosphere*| *|  yes, how shall I put this*| *|  yes, the atmosphere has improved. The male teachers at colleges are real nerds, technical things are their first passion in life. They only talk about technical things and precisely with the arrival of women, also other topics are talked about. I have had a technical training myself, but I am not a nerd. So I really enjoy being able to also talk about other stuff and not just technics.  |

I will put it this way: I was called after my grandfather. So, the same name as her husband. My given name was the same. And when I was little, this gave me a lot of advantages: that was given his name*| à*| nd that I was the name bearer in the family. Do you know that word?  |*| 4 | R: precisely, my grandmother thought this was very important. And I never realized it at the time but later on when I heard stories from the people around me, it became clear. That because of the fact – I think in the first place because I was named after my grandfather (given name) – yes, it gave me a number of advantages. My grandmother differentiated in those things.  |*| 5 |*| *|  |*| 6 | R: Well, coming to think about those things:’ Yes, it must have given me advantages!’. For example I cannot remember that she was ever angry at me. When I was very small, until I was six or something, we used to live in the same house: our family on one side and they on the other side. And my younger sister*| *|  I have two sisters. My eldest sister got along very well with her generally, she was very peaceful, she did a lot of embroidery work, sewing things etc. That was a bit of a hobby of my grandmother and she liked it anyway when children were quiet and peaceful. But the younger sister, she was a lot more lively. And yes, maybe she was a bit unusual, so she was very often scolded to. So the thing that I remember is that I always had a very good relationship with her.  |*| 7 |*| *|  |*| 9 | R: Yes, I have a son and he is also the name bearer (laughs)! |*| 11 | R: No, no, he was called after my father and the father of my wife. I like that, but I don’t take it any further. I like the fact that the names continue to exist but that would never be a reason for me to treat my daughter different from my son. Certainly not. |*| 13 | R: Yes, I think so. Although maybe nowadays you can chose, but it is still the custom to give a child the father’s name. And if you don’t want that, you have to specifically request it and arrange for it to be registered that way.  |

I do have this as well at times, but most of the time I can much more easily put things into perspective. And I notice that my girlfriend gets much more involved and gets carried away by things and can lose confidence  and feel unsure. And actually I – sometimes even in an irritating manner – react to this as follows: ‘Just let go of it! It’s no use to get wound up about it, it is a waste of energy, just let go!’ So, that is a clear difference that I notice and because of which I think: ‘yes!’ And I also think it is women specific, typically for women. That it is a tendency. Men don’t do that as much and have much more a tendency to just let go. Those are little things and women get much more wound up about it. |*| 4 | R: yes, I also notice this because other*| *|  men are also – and this has to do with the ability to put things into perspective – much more able to forgive and forget. In general with women, even if you do something minor wrong, they will be angry for a year so to speak. For men it is much more easy to get over such things. ‘There, let’s play cards together again!’. I think, yes*| *|  |*| 6 | R: Yes. |*| 8 | R: No, no. I cannot link it to them. In my family, feelings or emotions were not easily talked about*| *|  definitely not about insecurity or that sort of topics. No.  |*| 10 | R: Yes, yes.  |*| 12 | R: Yes, because of that, women are much more able to deal with their emotions and are much better at verbalizing their emotions.

Yes, men at times can be a bit more blunt because they are much less complicated. |*| 14 | R: Yes, a bit more uncomplicated and less thoughtful and they pay less attention to the consequences of certain remarks.  |*| 16 | R: yes, indeed! |

This about how I encountered the men-women balance in my environment, let’s call it like that*| *|  It is determined partly by the past and recently has been apparent to come from the relationship between my own parents. |*| 3 | R: My father was always working, very often away from home, worked abroad also and my mother was a full time housewife. And that was advantageous for me. I am more or less, well, spoiled, yes, spoiled. Anyway. Ok, I did not have to make my own sandwiches so in that sense spoiled.  I notice now*| *|  Because I myself am*| *|  I live together with my girlfriend now. I am convinced that both of us should do our share of the household, so not as my parents did it: my father worked and my mother was busy in the house. We both work, me and my girlfriend, and so I think we should both contribute to the household. That we both are responsible for the running of the house, shopping, cooking and I notice that I have trouble with this, because I used to be spoiled in those things. So, I find it more difficult*| *|  And then I oppose my girlfriend. I find it harder to intrinsically motivate myself to do things in the house. So that... |*| 5 | R: I do it, sometimes with a bit more resistance than I would like to show, but in the end I do it. Most of the time I do it in a slightly different way than how my girlfriend would do it. She dictates a bit more: ‘This place is a mess, it should be cleaned!’. I*| *|  my limits are a bit broader in those aspects.   |*| 7 | R: Yes, she also finds these things difficult at times. She feels as if she has to be the ‘mother’ in order to get me – to put it straight – off the couch.  |*| 8 | I Does that mean that she feels she has to bear more responsibility in those things? |*| 9 | R: Yes, at times she feels forced by me into the mothering role and that is a result of the way I was brought up. |*| 11 | R: Yes, I would like it if we would both be able to, well, the same as the idea I have now about the household, so that is how we should take care of the child as well. So we should both take care of the child. We both agree – we have been talking about this already – that we would each stay one day*| *|  That she would be working 3 days a week and I would be working 4 days a week. So that I would continue to work a bit more, but would also take care of the child one day a week. And she would do two days. So that we would divide that as well. And I also hope that I will participate more in the household by that time so as to avoid*| *|  yes, just like the idea I have about household, there is a norm behind it. I also agree that I should be doing more, but it is very hard to get myself moving I notice. But I also think that towards the child I should be much more of a role model, should participate in the household and do my share.  |*| 13 | R: Yes, and that does not mean that I disapprove of the way in which my parents did it. My father worked a lot, worked full time, more than full time in certain periods and also abroad. But I just think that we can both contribute our share and it is also nice to spend time with your child (or children of we would have them). Being able to both spend time with the children and raising the child together. But is does mean a change from what I was used to at home.  |

We had a book with fairy tales, thick book written by Grimm. And I – because I was enlightened on that aspect – I was very sensitive to those things. So I went to look at how these fairytales were put together. It were always the women, those nice, desperate women in need and then there was always a boy.  |*| 3 |*| *|  |*| 4 | Snow-white: She really has to lie waiting in that*| *|  I think it is almost a real metaphor – that this woman lies waiting in her glass death coffin and she lies waiting for a prince. And I thought: ‘Gosh, couldn’t you just spit that apple out on top of those little dwarves?’ Those little dwarves, those are supposed to be men, who are to take care of her, a big women, a kings daughter or whatever. And the only thing they can think of is to put her in a class coffin and to wait for a prince. That’s when I think: ‘Come on! Unbelievable! Snow-white, you’re a bitch! I also wrote a completely opposite story of Snow-white. Then I thought: ‘Little Red Ridinghood! Yes, Little Red Ridinghood is being send by her mother. So, she does all of that very nicely and eventually she is saved. Not by the mother who send her, not by some strong woman who says: ‘hey hold on! We don’t allow this type of thing!’ No, she needs a hunter to save her. Again not a women, not even her father. But it is the hunter, he has power because he wears a green cap and a gun. So there you have it again that Little Red Ridinghood cannot avoid what happens and is not even saved by the person who send her*| *|  that is to say: she goes and calls the hunter. |*| 5 |*| *|  |*| 6 | Oh yes, that is also when I discovered that I was not allowed to read boys books. ‘George and his rebel club’ I liked very much because he was always on to something and was sitting on his donkey backwards. Tintin, I liked Tintin, and the little dog as well, he could fix anything. But my mother said: ‘No, those are no books for you!’ Because those were my brothers books, he got them at a certain point. ‘No, those are no books for girls!’. I say: ‘yes but, what does that matter? A book is a book, isn’t it? I just like to get them.’ |*| 7 |*| *|  |*| 8 | A family with whom we were very good friends, got a boy, finally after three girls. We also had three girls at the same time so a boy came along. Well, they were thrilled because he was the bearer of the family name and all that was wonderful. That boy died. I think, with the current medical knowledge, it must have been Sudden Infant Death. Shortly afterwards the mother was pregnant again and she got a girl. They had a farm at home – across the street from us – and the three girls (the eldest ones) all had names of flowers and the boy had had an ordinary typical boys name. And when the last girl was born - the one that had my age – she was called the feminine version of that boys name (so no flower name for her). So she said: ‘I don’t understand it. Not that I like those flower names so much, but now I am called like my brother’. And when they call me out loud they even use the masculine form of the name (leaving out the last vocal) and that is not who I am!’ And she used to get the trousers that the other ones didn’t want any more – some sort of sleeping trousers – and I want skirts and things!’. I thought, that is how far they went. And I said to my mother: ‘This is so strange because she does not want to be called that name’. ‘Yes, that is the name she got and it is because they are grieving so much about the lost boy.’ And I thought: But what about the grief of the girl who thought : I have to be a boy, the bearer of the family name I can’t be*| *| ’ Well, this turned out very bad. Until a very old age she*| *|  Finally she.. her life ended in a very awkward way.  |

I did get something to hide the sadness. I had lots of fun with my husband and with my children, but I also started to develop an attitude: ‘Yes, I don’t even want to! What are you thinking? Do you think I care?’ And they organized coffee gatherings., and then*| *|  At a certain gathering I have*| *|  I had a pin button (the ones you attach to you shirt) and it said: ‘I do not belong here!’ And that was very dreadful of course, but I thought: ‘I am going to wear it!’ And I was sitting among 10 women and thought, they will start to comment on this. So, they were all staring at me*| *| 6 |*| *|  |*| 7 | R: And when the children had a certain age - the daughter, she was 4 or 5 at the time – At a certain point I was looking for a colleague in her that I was missing among those other housewives. And she said: ‘Do you want to help me?’ Well, if you really think*| *|  ‘You should not say it that way, you should say it in a normal way’. So at a certain point she said – all of a sudden she became like a colleague – because she said: ‘Mum, you are very angry. But why don’t you sit down for a second. Who are you angry with? Are you angry at me or are you tired or are you angry about something else?’ This was really amazing to come from such a young child. But it gave me such a good feeling that I said: ‘No, it is true! I am indeed angry about something else. Not at all because of you.’ So I will have explained it. Maybe it was because my hair was cut the wrong way or maybe because of some bad remark, or well*| *|  I don’t remember. But that remark of hers: Mum, please sit down, why are you angry, with whom are you angry?’ I really thought: ‘Gosh, for the first time I have somebody with whom I can have this.’ All this time I had just been going about, and I could have done the greatest things or the silliest things, I never got a reaction. And I think that a lot of women – when you talk to them later on – will say: ‘Yes, I recognize that!’ So, nowadays you do get recognition for things that were absolutely not possible in those days. Because it was strange, you did not do that. |*| 9 | R: Yes, just talking about yourself, about something that is beyond the cooking time of Brussels sprouts or gossip.  |

But I didn’t get pregnant, so I said: ‘Listen, we can talk about this endlessly, let’s just have it checked and then, well, then*| *|  What do they investigate? The woman! While my husband was not at all negative about it. So I asked: ‘I don’t mind being checked because I want to know what I am up to, but what about my husband?’ No, no, no, we don’t do that! So, you felt unsure: ‘Is this right?’ If both of us can’t have children, well, ok, than we need to accept that. Then you re-arrange your life accordingly. But if you have to continue to doubt?’ Well, we dropped it. I didn’t get pregnant in the first period but I thought: well, they did a medical treatment, so we’ll see’. Finally it happened. But again men-woman*| *|  I don’t think it is still that way, but in those days, really, I can still even remember the name of that doctor: ‘No, not your husband, but you!’.  |*| 4 | R: Yes, my sister – who is from a much later generation – they told her: ‘you and your husband’. And after she found out that with her everything was ok, she didn’t want to put him through the ordeal and so they never had any children. And still they have – they’re also above 60 now – that feeling: ‘well, what confrontation was I trying to avoid?‘. If a woman remains the same whether or not she can bear children, a man also stays the same whether or not he can produce the seed that make them. I always thought this was something big.  |*| 5 |*| *|  |*| 6 | R: Oh, yes, this is also very strange, when you don’t have children, people start to avoid you. ‘So, what is wrong? Because having children is considered the ultimate goal in women’s lives!’ It wasn’t even considered that there might be women who say: ‘No, I don’t want to have children!’ and still feel completely feminine .  |*| 7 | When we send the birth announcement for our second daughter, we got many remarks along the lines of: ‘What a pity that it isn’t a son!’  ‘Did you hope for a son?’, I went to look for these cards: ‘So, a second daughter can be fun as well!’ |*| 9 | R: AS WELL!! We were completely enthusiast about it! And then they said: ‘You shouldn’t take this so seriously, we didn’t mean to offend’ and then exclamation mark, thinking they had made a nice remark!

Getting married was not on my mind at all at that time. I wasn’t busy thinking about such things, I was playing cow-boy and Indian and was not at all thinking about marriage. ‘And your brother will do it!’ Yes, there were many years between the two of us. So, the trust was heavily shattered*| *|  If they would have explained it: ‘Listen, we were too afraid to tell you and this did give you the advantage of extra lessons in French, and we want the money*| *| ’ Than the trust would not have been broken. Now I had the feeling: the trust is gone*| à*| 8 | R: Yes, exactly! |*| 9 | R: Yes, it is true and this is*| *|  what happens then is not only*| *|  So, you’re not allowed with those friends ( we were not many) to go to the gymnasium. But first of all you lose your self-confidence: ‘What is wrong that they now say I can’t?’ And the reason they came up with (marriage) was really ridiculous. Marriage? Come on! And then the broken trust of your parents who have deceived you for some years, that is incomprehensible. I still think this is incomprehensible. I made up a story of my own about it. But I did still test my knowledge by completing all the exam questions – had them on a little note – and I completed it very well. That feeling: ‘It is not about me, because I would have done great!’ That feeling I kept up high, but still it didn’t take away the disappointment.  |*| 11 | R: My brother has*| *|  He HAD to, because also for him it was not a choice whether or not to study. He had to study. Really this very traditional pattern: yes, you have to be able to earn money. So my brother went to the HBS and he was very intelligent. He could have done it easily, but didn’t want to: ‘I will not be forced into such a school!’. And he messed it up, he never got a diploma!

I do have brothers who did try to do something else first but all of them tried something with the farm as well. For us girls that was not at all expected.

Yes, you don’t talk about these things. So yes, that is the way it is. And with my eldest sister I remember that it was also specifically said: She’s going to get married anyway so it doesn’t matter what type of studies she does.’ And indeed, my brothers lived on the farm with their wives, so they all did what was traditionally expected from them. That perspective was absolutely not interesting for me. I didn’t like it at all.  |*| 10 | R: Yes, I think it meant freedom to me, mainly.  |

I had done the HAVO section of secondary school, so that is preliminary to a HVO level study. That was much too easy actually. So I also did VBO, then I did HWO and when I was 20 I was already teaching. I was a crafts teacher. I thought: ‘Well, this is NOT it!’. So I went and studied again, I went to university. What influenced that decision? One of the motivating factors was the fact that I had a boyfriend at the time. He was horrible. He always said: ‘if you can’t explain something, you don’t really understand it!’. So he was really into knowledge! So in fact this stimulated me very much. So he was really condescending towards me, because he thought that I was*| *|  that I couldn’t analyze things properly and couldn’t lecture properly. So because of he, mine, yes actually by making me look smaller, I started thinking: ‘What? I will show you what I can!’. (laughs) I can remember that that was one of the motivating factors for me to go to university. And I really enjoyed it very much.

I thought it would sound interesting. And I also liked the theme of the research: linguistic research. It is a very nice university. But at the moment that they assigned me to my office where I was supposed to study, I thought: ‘wooooh!’ I felt immediately constrained in my freedom. I was very much accustomed to a lot of freedom to go where I wanted to, to study, to work, then doing something nice, and then a short assignment for this or this person. So that was*| *|

On the one hand I really wanted to have children and on the other hand I was scared: ‘You have a child and then the relationship breaks off and then you won’t have money and it becomes*| *| ’. I had a very gloomy scenario in my head when I thought about children. I thought that the responsibility was too big. But anyway, then I was living in the Dominican Republic and I met someone who had a very nice son and then I started thinking: ‘I would like, with him*| *| ’ Well, it was a love relationship, but also very clearly: ‘with him I would like to have a child!’. And I know that partly this was because I knew he would not play a big role in raising the child. That is a very rational logical calculation I think. So obviously it is love and you don’t just randomly pick a man. It was a man of whom I thought: ‘I would want him to be the father of my child, he is a loving man.’ But as a‘parent’ I didn’t think he was up to the task and that is very normal in the Caribbean culture. People always have children from several fathers and fathers sometimes play a role in raising the children but more often don’t or hardly do. So, that was ok in that context. It worked a lot better than if I would have chosen to do this in the Netherlands because in the Netherlands, the men demand their fatherhood or their role in raising the children. Men in the Netherlands say: ‘I don’t want a child unless I can participate in raising it!’. So*| *|  |*| 5 | R: Yes, because here, taking up responsibility for your child is very important. That is very important. The men that I know, those whom I appreciate, in fact most men, take this very seriously. Just as much serious as the women I know. They have ideas about educational models and styles and you should combine that with your work and what you want to offer your child and choice of partners with whom you want to have that child. So, in a Caribbean culture these things don’t count. So having a child is considered a positive thing for a men, but having to take care of it is optional. You can if you want to, but are not obliged or expected. And if women demand anything, it will be financial support. So, that freedom that I experienced in this matter, a lot of the Caribbean women have and the African as well. It is even a lot worse in the African culture. That the responsibility for the children*| *|  it’s the women who take that up together. It is society doing it together, but not so much an individual couple. Here it is really the couple who are considered to be responsible. Surely I did have hard feelings about it at times. And surely I did think at times: ‘ Well, I did once*| *| ’ So I raised her and every two years*| *|  I have a very good relationship with her father, still a very loving relationship. We even had sort of a love relationship at a distance when I came back to the Netherlands. And I thought it would be better to go back every two years so that she can see her father and the village and the cousins and the nephews, etc. So that is what we do. That is the responsibility I take. But I also once*| *|  that was a real confrontation*| *|  I as once in Nicaragua for my work and I was coaching ex-pats there and I met someone who was in the reverse situation. So, he also has a 14 year old daughter, that is nice. So the mother of the daughter just decided: ‘Well, I take her along to the Netherlands.’ Just in the same way as I had decided that.  |*| 7 | R: No, a Dutch men, he had lived in Nicaragua quite long, 10 to 15 years or something, but he had a partner who was also Dutch and they had a daughter together. So, the relationship was not running well, and she just decided to go back to the Netherlands and to take the daughter along. This was very painful for him. This was a sort of mirror to me. I thought: ‘Oh, yes, that’s true!’. So a Dutch men does not consider it normal that you take your child away from him because he has a sense of responsibility and a loving relationship with the child and this means that it is very painful. So I thought that that was very confrontational, that father. And I thought: ‘well, I never really wanted to think about this at all!’.  |*| 9 | R: Well, I did want to have a second child and that is when he said: ‘I don’t want that!’. I do not want to have another child that is so far away. So that was*| *|  yes, the main thing he said about that.  |

In the Netherlands both partners are entitled to chose the name they will use after they get married: either they can keep their own name, or they can chose the name of the partner or both names and decide in what order they should be put. And I remember that we were going to get married and we went to the city hall to arrange it and automatically the clerk gave me a paper to fill in about the name issue. So this is one little story. |*| *|  what did you do? |*| 4 | R: I did fill in the form and I don’t know if I specifically asked at the time: ‘why doesn’t he get this form?’ I can image that I must have said something, but not something like: ‘He should get this’ or ‘This is stupid !’. Not that. |*| 6 | R: My own name first and the name of my partner behind it. |*| 8 | R: He certainly did not say that, at the time. |*| 10 | R: Because I thought it was a nice way to show the world that we had chosen to be together.  |*| 12 | R: No, apparently not. I didn’t make a point out of it at all. We did have a talk about it beforehand, knowing that this would be an option, but I can’t remember how that talk went. But surely I didn’t say: ‘You should really do this!’. And I also remember that I was not sad about him not doing it, so it was not so important for me. |*| 14 | R: Well, I don’t think this is Unfair, but I do think that it is a sure sign that the law might have changed but that the standard mentality it still that women will change their name and men don’t*| *|  So legally there is a choice, it is not automatically arranged. But the clerk at the desk still thinks that : ‘The women will change her name  and the husband doesn’t.’ So in that sense, it wasn’t that I felt discriminated against, but I was just surprised that automatically it was presumed that only I would use the option.  |*| 16 | R: Yes, I liked it. I liked the fact that my name came first and also that his name followed. The reason why I did it, I still approved, also afterwards.  |*| 18 | R: No, no, totally not. (laughs) on the contrary! Because my sister had just kept her own name. |*| 20 | R: Yes, not that they thought it was very important, rather not. But it was surely not a standard expectation that I would add the name of my husband.  |

Or that it mattered. I thought: I am human and by coincidence I happen to be a human of the female type. Apparently that was the message that my parents gave me. |*| 3 |*| *|  |*| *|  or that it could be an advantage to be a woman. |*| 5 | R: Yes, that was very late! (laughs) That I really wanted to be a woman. It was only*| *|  well, maybe when I was 22 or something? Well, I should have told you about my soccer. I was playing soccer, when I started studying, that was when I was 20, I started playing soccer. That’s where you encounter a lot of prejudices and stereotypes. For example, that fact that I was playing soccer and did not have a boyfriend*| *| -  certainly for one person, but probably for more persons but I didn’t check it with them – this was a reason to think that I would be a lesbian. That’s a story too. |*| 7 | R: They automatically thought that if you played soccer and you were a woman, and you didn’t prove that you liked men, it means you were a lesbian.  |*| 9 | R: Yes, yes, and especially (and it really is that way, at least in the Netherlands) that the percentage lesbian women is bigger among the group of women who are a soccer team together. The percentage of lesbians in a soccer team is indeed bigger than on an average other group of women. So it is not so strange, but still. That’s what I encountered.  |*| 10 |*| *|  |*| 11 | R: Well, I think as a secondary school student, I think I automatically thought: ‘Mathematics, chemistry, physics, , yes, I can’t do those things and I am a girl so it is logical that I can’t do those things.’.*| *|  Yes, so the fact that it isn’t worthwhile to invest in those things, because I am a girl. And yes, mathematics B – this is the more complicated form of mathematics – yes, that was not for me.  |*| 13 | R: Yes, from my parents, they said that in our family, we were not fit for mathematics. But I don’t know if this implied that it was because you are a girl you can’t do mathematics. I don’t think so, but it is*| *|  Yes, you don’t need your parents to find out that girls are no good in ‘beta topics’. That is being said in so many ways. Only much later on I heard that in Italy mathematics is a real girls subject. But I didn’t know that at the time.  |*| 15 | R: I have studied health sciences and certainly no ‘beta topics’. And I wanted to – because that is how I got to this point – I wanted to become an archeologist and I had heard that you should do mathematics B to become an archeologist. That’s when I thought – I was 13 or 12 at the time – yes, this will not succeed. Probably I really was not good at mathematics, but that being said, I also thought: ‘well, it is not worthwhile to invest in it because I am a girl and so will not be successful in this anyway!’. |*| 17 | R: yes, yes |*| 19 | R: Yes, those stereotypes do exist when it comes to beta-topics.  |

And I have to add that there is no one in my circle of friends who says now already: ‘No, I would not want to work!’. All of those are highly educated persons. Yes, everybody aspires to work. So, in that sense I think it is positive that it has become something obvious.*| *|  I work among a lot of communication departments and P&O (personnel and organization) and a lot of young women work there.

Well, I have already published several things and people track you and get in touch with you, so all of this is starting to run now. But, you notice – I have had several meetings now – and very often you immediately notice that they think: ‘ok, so you are a young girls and that sells easily.’ So it is immediately*| *|  I have literally had a talk with someone who said: ‘oh, so we can put you here and there in our brochure, between those two, and we can take your picture and cover the whole back of the book with it, and we can do this and that*| *| ’ So at a certain point (but this was an extreme example) at a certain point the content was not discussed at all. Then I thought: ‘hey, hold on, I also have something worthwhile to say!’. So I notice at this point in this sector, there is the tendency to do as much as possible. You see young new authors popping up everywhere. Very often they are women or girls and I think it is a ‘shot’ or something: ‘let’s give it a try and maybe we catch something!’.  |*| 17 | R: Yes, that is difficult to say because that is not what I am. But yes, maybe just a little bit. I think it is*| *| 19 | R: Yes, fair? I just notice that I use it sometimes, also because I am not sure how those things work. It is all new to me.

So it is very much dominated by women. And as you move upwards towards the secondary school and university, they are a lot less represented. There you have a lot more male teachers. What I have noticed is that the primary education is very much oriented – because of that – towards girls. For example, I had a female teacher when I was about 10 and if we were going to do something nice, than it would be picking berry’s in the woods and making jam or making cookies or ginger bread when St. Nicolas (local children festival) came. And that was what the whole class was supposed to do. And of course, for girls this is really their thing, this is what they like. But I also remember that when St. Nicolas had come (he brings presents for the children at night, just like Santa Claus), the day afterwards all pupils could bring their presents to show to the others. Well, everybody brought their present and if the boys had something like an ‘action man’ or a sword or something, it was just not*| *| . You know, the teacher also, she just skipped those toys. It wasn’t good or something. So I think*| *|  |*| 4 | R: Because those toys were linked to aggression you know, teaching the wrong things and it should be suppressed.  |*| 5 |*| *|  |*| 6 | R: You know, boys are a lot wilder and stuff, but nowadays this is immediately seen as problematic behavior. And I don’t know, if it is so simple, but it could be linked to the fact that there are so many women in primary education and so there is a consensus that you are taught in a very feminine way about what is good or not good, what is good behavior or bad behavior.  |*| 7 |*| *|  |*| *|  and I can imagine that it also leads to a sort of explosion of people with ADHD (Attention, Deficit, Hyper-activity Disorder). And this puts them in a problematic category. I can imagine that if your behavior is systematically suppressed and told that it is not good, than in the end you also think it is not good.  |*| 10 |*| *|  |*| 12 | R: Yes, from time to time I have trouble with it. That it is still the case that in some economic sectors (care sector, education maybe also in the cultural sector to a certain degree) that it is still dominated by women. And there is also the famous glass ceiling.  |*| 13 |*| *|  |*| 15 | R: Yes, I don’t know if I think it should be the government who does that. I also think that if you are talking for example about a school; the school itself should be able to determine that. I also think the matter about the quota is very complicated you know. For example: so much % of persons in the parliament or wherever, should be female. And then you try to reach that goal. Then I think: ‘yes, but then you are*| *| ’ On the one hand I think it is good to equalize things, but you are also doing something to someone*| *|  for the wrong reasons, make a selection. So I think*| *| . Lately someone told me: ‘yes, but I don’t vote with my breasts!’ And I thought: ‘Yes, that is true, because that is what it is about’. So I find it hard. |*| 16 |*| *|  |*| 17 | R: Nowadays I work in a cultural center here in the center of town and yes, we notice it as well. We organize all sorts of seminars on literature, but also politics and science and each time it is always much more difficult to find female speakers. Those who eventually become the speakers*| *|  We – because the head of our cultural center is also a women – and we are only with 4 people working there, so it is not very big. But our head also thinks that it is very important to pay attention to this, to assure that we also have women. I think this is very good. But I do regret that it is hard to find them.*| *| 19 | R: Yes, I don’t know. What I experience now at work, I find in general, yes, yes*| *|  |*| 21 | R: Yes, I think partly*| *|  Yes, I think partly it is that way and it is a pity that a male characteristic*| *| . If it is determined culturally, or genetically, I wouldn’t know. But you do need it to get to the top. So, you need a lot of male characteristics ! Because my employer  is pretty much*| *|  she’s very put in her ways,  and she writes articles for newspapers and she does a lot of things. But it is also a woman whom I would characterize as having a lot of male qualities. So a women who takes decisions straight away, and who is not easily intimidated. I think it is a pity that I notice that even I immediately qualify those things as macho, male even*| *|  |*| 23 | R: Yes, that is the strange bi-polar division that exists! This is very strange, but I think that is the way things work. The further you get, the higher you climb up the ladder, the more everything is dominated by men.  |

The owner of that shop was a foreigner and since he was in the textile business he was often coming and going abroad to buy cloth anyway and he used to tell me 'in my absence you must manage my establishment'. I was employed there with four ladies and the same thing it was a headache to settle these four ladies to do the work. You know, this one doesn’t want to do this job, the other does not want to do the other task, even when they saw that I took his place, in his stead, they sort of did not really accept the situation, in fact one of them told me once 'listen, we salesgirls, you are a salesman, sort of, you do the same tasks like we do', and I had told them 'listen, he asked me to take his place'. He used to be absent for a month, two months (...) away from Malta and I had to manage the shop, I was responsible for the finances, I mean I was responsible for stocktaking, everything) (and he used to tell me, for example, there are certain documents you must get them from customs, and it was difficult to leave the shop, to leave the salesgirls alone, and when I return and you know they were supposed to clean the shop window and they didn’t, the floor was supposed to be washed and it wasn’t, there was that sort of pique because you are like us, now I used to do all the jobs too to be totally honest, but he used to tell me 'no, you must give the orders and they must obey', but they did not really accept this. |*| 3 | R: I think that was one of the reasons, a man among four women, and he also gave me his place, in his absence, and that they did not really accept it  |*| 5 | R: No, I had been there longer, in fact I also kept the keys of the shop, I was responsible for opening and closing, I think this had also affected them also that I had been there longer and then the others were employed later  |*| 7 | R: It is possible that it’s because he gave me the role of the shop owner I was taking his place and it could also be that it’s because I was a man among four ladies  |*| 9 | R: Yes they were younger, much younger or younger. |*| 11 | R: It is possible that one factor was age because at that time I was over thirty and they were twenty-five, twenties.

We brought them up as we could with the help of God, they got married and anyway I was the last one left at home and I remember I then told my mother 'now my siblings are all gone and I still feel the desire for a religious life', but then the Lord wanted otherwise, then I remember I attened a theology course at the Domenicans for lay people and exactly there I met my present wife, I mean it’s a long story about how she also felt she wanted to do the same course and from there we met and now we are married and I have a seventeen year old boy and I thank God we are happy, beautiful life. |*| 18 | (...) |*| 22 | R: To start my life as a priest  |*| 24 | R: That, because I always was, even when my father was still alive I used to tell him how much I wished to become a priest. |*| 25 | (...) |*| 29 | R: Exactly yes  |*| 31 | R: No she had not.  |*| 33 | R: Exactly  |*| 35 | R: I think that mostly from the man, and then I remember also my sister then sort of she was engaged and then she wanted to get married quickly sort of to have her own place and the more so I felt the responsibility myself, I said I must do my part.  |*| 37 | R: Exactly and I was the eldest, more so, and then, like I told you, all the responsibility fell on me to take my father’s place.  |*| 38 | (...) |*| 40 | R: As such, it did not affect me as such, I mean something good came out of it for me personally. It helped me grow in maturity, in responsibility. Now that I a m a father, should my son in future face a similar problem, I know how to tackle it in order to show him how to keep moving forward in life should the same thing happen to him.  |*| 41 | (...) |*| 45 | R: Well because I also believed that what I was doing, I was doing that with God’s help because alone I can’t do anything. |*| 46 | (...) |*| 48 | R: A lot, yes.  |*| 50 | R: totally positive  |*| 52 | R: Yes and no, but mostly I think because like we said I ask myself, because I was the eldest and they expected a lot of me it’s a question mark  |*| 54 | R: Exactly  |*| 56 | R: did not shoulder the responsibility. |

This I think I can sincerely say was an unexpected opportunity but there arose the possibility that I go for a work experience abroad, and as I was already involved in that kind of work in Malta, my wife too encouraged me and told me 'listen, go for the experience; it will be an added value on your cv', you understand (...) and that’s what I did, and I left, and I spent a whole year on my own and my wife stayed in Malta. She worked in Malta, so even from that point of view, it was not a question that she could accompany me easily, but also because we considered it to be a temporary situation, it was not worth moving the children around. So we took that decision. If I had to think about it a little bit, had it been the other way round, that the opportunity arose in the case of my wife, I don’t know whether the same thing would have happened, that she would leave for a year. I don’t know because it did not happen, but I can say that especially because of the children, they were both small, I think that even on her part I think she would have resisted going abroad and leaving the children behind. The factor that I can tie to is my experience, of the family, there is a very strong tie between the children and my wife. I also have a tie to my children, but, as a result of certain experiences that we had when the children were very small, I think that that tie that my wife had become stronger because they had gone through a problem so there was a stronger tie. |*| 4 | R: That’s how I interpret the situation. As it did not happen it is hypothetical but from the way we talk every day, that’s how I would interpret the situation, hypothetically, I am not sure, let me put it in brackets, because both of us, me and my wife, about this thing are very open. For example when the time had come for us to take a scholarship we had sort of agreed that whoever gets the scholarship first he goes and the partner will follow. We didn’t have children then. |*| 7 | (...) |*| 9 | R: I think that it was easier. |*| 11 | R: Yes I think it was easier. |*| 13 | R: I can imagine that happening; I don’t imagine that she would have gone and the children and myself would have stayed behind, since she was... I mean, since she would have needed more help in order to find a place to live, she has to get used to the place. I mean, to leave a person on her own like that... It can happen, but it’s not something that... At least the way I see it in our family, most probably I would have moved myself as well and I don’t exclude the fact that she would have gone on her own. I don’t exclude that in the sense that I spend a lot of time with the children so that she could go (...) I mean she was never hampered from doing anything because of the children as such. Naturally the fact that I left and I spent one year on my own, she had a busier time because she was still working and added to the fact that she had to cope with the children on her own because obviously the children from that aspect were an important factor. The children were an important factor but if I had to talk about hours we never had a problem for her to leave and I remember sometimes even for a few days the children stayed with me alone (...). |

And I was placed at a bank, and naturally, as you know one dresses smartly there and so on (...) I remember I had registered for a course in education, and the manager there often used to tell me 'listen, why on earth did you choose teaching, wouldn't it have been better to become a lawyer?' Now I think there was a link with the fact that teaching very often was considered to be a female profession. On the other hand, it could also be an important factor in those days that a lawyer - I think also nowadays - are better paid than teachers. But even this could be a factor related to gender, the way the professions are paid, but I can’t amplify on this. |*| 5 | R: It is possible that this had something to do with it. But at home, for example, I had no pressure in this regard except that my mother for some time, I think mostly my mother, used to encourage me to become a policeman, I don’t know why, I think, how shall I say, so that I would have a more stable job and then it depends what branch of the police force because there are also parts. |*| 7 | R: You can specialise. Sometimes you have to attain courses from university, not simply straight-forward. |*| 9 | R: My father’s sister, my aunt, was in teaching. She was a teacher of Italian. |*| 11 | R: I don’t think so, although I had been to her class a couple of times. For fun, you know, for the fun of entering my aunt’s classroom, because we used to live opposite the school. But then, when she got married, she went to live in Italy. |*| 13 | R: I depended on me one hundred per cent and I think the most important reason that kept me studying to become a teacher was the tie..., not the tie, but I think the love I had for the Italian language to study for a BA in Italian, there was no course in those days (...) I entered the BEd; the classroom contact never bothered me. It was a factor when I started teaching that I liked very much, the contact with the students, and for me it was an occasion to keep in touch with Italian. Naturally when the issue of the scholarship came up then one specialises without wanting to; you get more tied to that particular chair. |*| 15 | (...) |*| 19 | R: One that I remember in particular, he was a priest, he was a priest, and it so happened that we used to be on the same school bus (Name of cities) and he... We used to talk a lot on the school bus and he used to give me a lot of feedback on the work that I was doing and the homeworks and so on and he had really encouraged me for some reason once, a summary, about a summary that I had done, I think I had done really well, in the sense that the feedback he gave me was very good and then we stayed... |*| 21 | R: Form 3, I think. |*| 23 | R: It was still early to decide, but from there, from there I think, I can say in Italian, I can also remember that for a short period of time I wished to become a pilot and I used to...My aunt used to travel to work in L(name) the travelling I think that was the element rather than the aeroplanes I think.  |*| 25 | R: finish your question |*| 29 | R: No, no |*| 31 | R: Not even, it was very evident when I started education as such; it was almost clear that I think I had never seen a man, but once I took over a kindergarten class when I was still on a workphase, the headmaster asked me and I accepted willingly. |*| 32 | (...)  |

It doesn’t pay and secondly I can do it because my wife works. I mean at the end of the day if my wife does not work I would need to change my decisions, but I don’t want my children to experience the trauma of putting their mind at rest because their father has a shop and they can work in his shop, do you understand me? Because nowadays if they become employees, they earn a lot more money than we earn in the shop. |*| 6 | R: In fact there was great trouble because two of my sisters worked for my father. When I came along I became their boss, and they complained and quarrelled because obviously they were more experienced in the business. But he said that I was the male and I must take over, I mean in this case it was to my advantage. But again to be fair, it’s because his mentality was that the man is responsible to provide, the man is the head of the family. That’s why I took over (...). I mean this was to my advantage. In fact I had a big argument with my sister who had been working there for twenty years, no joke, and I told my father it’s either me or her, and he decided it was me because I carry the name of the family. She was married. I mean, at the end of the day, I will keep the family name going, not her. (...) But that’s the irony of life over which I have no control (...). |

Nowadays I appreciate college for the simple reason that I learned how to make my bed, I learned how to cook, the basic things in life, I think that if I had stayed at home with my six sisters and mother, I don’t think I would have learned them in full force, so to speak, but this was an experience in my life when I was very angry about the fact that I was the only boy, because I really felt that my parents did not love me. It was not the case, but that’s what I thought as a boy. (...) In those days, in the case of my family, given that my siblings are all girls, I used to think that the woman is stronger than the man because I was the only boy. For example, if I want to go out and buy an ice-cream and three of my siblings do not want to buy an ice-cream, the decision was theirs. Maybe not because they were girls, but in those days that’s what I used to think in the sense that I thought there was a great imbalance between a man and a woman. |*| 10 | R: Definitely. And I never had any say and I can assure you that whoever thinks that because you are a boy amongst six girls you are spoilt to death, it’s not the case. (...) Life now has shown now that I am married and I have three children, and the role between myself and my wife changed in the sense that I look after the children and my wife works (...) I think that in my case, boarding helped me become very independent. Maybe if I had stayed at home I would not have developed the character I have today. (...) Independent in the sense that I explained that you are able to do the basic things in life. I mean, if you need to you can sew a button, you know how to cook (...) but I won’t send my children to boarding school because (...) I suffered too much. I think that when you compare the things I learned with the suffering I endured, I don’t think it was worth it, because the things that I learned, I think one can adapt to the situation anyway. (...) As a boarder you were just a number. We used to sleep forty of us in a hall on top of each other. There wasn’t, you’re a mother you can understand me, there wasn’t the love of one’s parents, you understand? I mean the children nowadays (I can understand this because I am a father) children need a point of reference. I mean when they have a problem even a simple thing, I don’t know, there was a boy who bullied me because I was small the brother would tell you you gave to grow up with it maybe your father maybe would tell you listen try to deal with it in this way or that other way, because there was no bond (...) and this thing used to hurt me a lot that I never found anyone to talk to (...) I won’t send my children because I think it is important that one of the parents is always present for the children I mean if not both parents at least one of them (...) |

So when I was about nineteen years old, there was this friend of mine, she was my friend and we used to discuss at length because we were very close friends. She had a relationship with another man and at first she was happy, but then she decided she was no longer happy. And she left him. She decided to part with him and she used to come to talk to me; not because she needed advice but because she just wanted to speak her mind, (...) open up to me because she was feeling bad and she was not sure whether she had taken the right decision. Now I used to observe this in other women too. (...)  She used to follow her heart, to follow her emotions, not her intellect. And she continued to suffer for months. On my part, I can see that men reason with their intellect, not with their heart, while this particular friend had let emotions take over almost completely. She went on suffering for months, because she continued to see him and then he refused to see her and this was very difficult for her. But then, at one point in time, I could no longer listen to this story. (...) I told her that when she decides to use her intellect and place her reasoning before her heart, then she will stop suffering. Before you do that, don’t speak to me again. I mean, I was tough on her, but it was for her own good. In fact, after about a month she stopped altogether. (...) I don’t know to what extent I had influenced her. I don’t know. It could be that she realised, but I told her what I wanted to tell her. As for me, I can tell you that she helped me understand women better; that you have to be prepared to appreciate that part of the woman that, how shall I say, that her heart rules her mind, sort of. You have to give her time; to give her time to first do that transition between thinking with her heart and thinking with her mind. I think that for a woman, it is more difficult to go through that transition from thinking with her heart to thinking with her mind. I think for a man... At least, let’s say I don’t find it so difficult. That was my first experience for you. |*| 4 | R: Yes. Yes, in fact this is what I want to tell you, that then, when I had a girlfriend myself eventually... How shall I say... For a woman, she used to tell me the family is important. When we are talking, she tells me that for her the family is very important and that her ties to her family are very strong, while mine not. That my ties aren’t strong. |*| 8 | R: yes yes |*| 10 | R: Yes, that I think for a man... I think family for him is important, let us say. I can talk from my experience as a man because then there are men who might have their own opinion as well. I think that a man is more important. Now, this is also society that we are leaving behind these days, with both sexes working together. We are leaving it behind, with both sexes working together; the same rights, everything the same. But I don’t know whether it’s the fact that the man has always been the breadwinner, let’s say, the one who brought money into the home, but I think that a man has more influence even nowadays.That work... |*| 14 | R: The dynamic that she goes through, the small processes that she goes through... I think that now I can empathize with a woman’s feelings, the dynamics, the way her mind works, what she goes through. |

(...) For example, I start by saying that I left school when I was fourteen years old and in those days there were no job opportunities in Malta. It’s around the sixties and I was in a family of nine siblings. We were four boys and five girls. The boys decided to emigrate since they did not find a job in Malta. My parents did not object. They had to sign on their behalf because they were still young. And they emigrated to A(name) except for one brother who was only fourteen years old, too young. In the meantime, we are growing up the girls, and I used to tell her \""mummy why don’t we find a job outside the home\""? She used to tell us \""no\"" and that really hurt me, because I felt that for my brothers they signed on their behalf and they went to live abroad, and me because I am a girl I can’t even leave home. This was so because in those days the families had a tendency that for girls it was dishonourable to go and work outside the home. |*| 4 | R: They believed that a girl’s place was at home. Always. They thought that a girl’s place was at home. |*| 6 | R: Everyone yes. Because all my friends went through the same experience that they wished to go. Because when you are in your youth, you wish maybe to buy something to wear. You cannot, because the family had no finances, and you cannot look for a job outside the home. |*| 8 | R: So then, when we found ourselves in this situation, we were five girls. Don’t forget that in those days the girl needed to have a dowry. The dowry by force you had to buy it. We decided, myself and my older sister that we start working from the home. I forgot to tell you that my father used to sell animal fodder, with a van, around the streets. |*| 10 | R: ... finances in the family because there was not enough money for a dowry for five girls. We could not find a job outside the home, therefore we had to invent something. In the meantime, my father used to sell animal fodder, right. Now myself and my older sister we decided that we start reading recipes and we cook them and we try them out. And my father started experiencing a loss in his business because people stopped keeping animals in their homes, and he changed to selling confectionary what we cooked myself and my sister. Our work was in request and we even organised wedding and baptism receptions. We had a problem: we did not have money, so we had to change the system from my father selling fodder to selling confectionary. And so we had to buy a new van. We had seen this as an enormous problem to pay for this van because it was very expensive. But with the help of God, with my mother’s care (I want to mention that my mother was very careful), we managed to pay for the van. I want to say we never had any debt. And with the help of God we got married. We took all our needs. She gave us a double dowry. Because to tell you the truth my mother even bought a house for my older sister, because she had planned that if the business continues to be so successful she had also wished to buy us a house each. But that plan failed, and we had to stop and we had to rent when we got married, those of us younger than my older sister.  |*| 12 | R: Now I said that us, the girls, we shouldered the responsibility both of the finances of the house as well as of the work. Because apart from the work that we did for the business, the maintenance of the house - if we need to whitewash, if we need to pull down a wall, we carry the stones. We had to do everything. We had to do everything, us the girls. There was still one brother at home, because he was fourteen years old, at home. But he was studying furniture craft. In the morning, we used to get up early, the girls, to distribute the confectionary that we made to the shops. But him, no. He never gave his share, because he had to go to work. Because he had to get up to go to work at seven, because he started work at a quarter to eight his day at work. (...) This I find to be a discrimination because I used to think 'all his needs, his food and everything, he is taking everything from in here'. Absolutely no help from the boys. Had it not been for us, girls, who encouraged each other, I don’t know, I don’t know how we would have ended up in my family.  |*| 14 | R: Yes, yes, yes. My mother never had any money in the bank. She could not afford it, even if she wanted to. But thank God, we always had enough for our needs. I can’t say that we ever went to bed hungry. |"

And I used to take many antibiotics, even if one should not take them more then three times per year, antibiotics. The Director should have investigated and if he wanted to prove that I was lying, he should have checked at least. |*| 12 | R: Yes, exactly. That’s it. To give me the benefit of the doubt, to ridicule me, he should have come to check. And I also used to find cigarette stubs in my dustbin. That was a message to tell me that they would continue to smoke. Because the cleaner was also a man and he also used to come to smoke in the same office. I don’t know for sure who put those ashes, but I was very hurt. I took photographs and I sent them to the Director and he did nothing, he did not even send me an acknowledgement.  |*| 14 | R: Exactly. That’s why I found another place to work. Because my voice was neither heard nor respected.  |*| 16 | R: Yes, yes. |*| 18 | R: Politics yes. Because the Union person was with me.

I experienced that some things are unfair because what they wanted to teach me, they did not want to teach my brother. What do I mean? With regard to housework for example, which to me it ought to be shared, because we are both enjoying from the things of the family. And so I considered that the work has to be between two. But for my parents, they... For me, they have very semitic ideas, like that the cleaning of the house has to be done by the woman. And there was a time... For example, when my mother used to tell me \""I won’t feed you if you don’t help me\"". And I used to retaliate. I used to tell her then \""my brother won’t eat either because he is not helping you\"". For me, that’s stupid that the woman has to be a sort of slave of the house. For me, it’s important that if the woman is intelligent, let her go. You understand? If she’s not intelligent, teach her other things, but give her support. It’s not fair you only support the male so that he can achieve what he likes and the woman no, because it is important that she stays at home. You understand? |*| 7 | R: They brought him up like that. They brought him up like that. Because even if you take dinner time, for example, he does not even remove his chair or his plate. He just sits there because they brought him up like that. He doesn’t know otherwise. And now he takes advantage of it. In fact even when he visits my mother he still behaves in the same way. He’s not going to change. Given that my mother is happy to serve him, he’s not going to change, you understand. |*| 9 | R: In the area of education, it was like that at the beginning. But then, how shall I say, I showed that I wanted to advance. My brother, for instance, did not want to continue his education. Obviously, in a way I was lucky that my mother had wanted an education and it was refused her. (...) She wanted to continue schooling and it was refused her, because she was the oldest of the children in the family and she had to care for her younger siblings. |*| 11 | R: She did not repeat the same mistake because she realised what she had missed. But for instance in other matters like leisure, going out, my brother had every right to go wherever he wanted to without her ever asking him where he was going and he could return home any time he liked, but me no. So I kind of felt when it came to going out... |*| 13 | R: ... limited. Very limited really. (...) Even, for example, in these days at Easter even to go to the Good Friday procession. |*| 17 | R: Exactly, exactly. I made the mistake of putting a rope around my neck. |*| 21 | R: Right. |*| 23 | R: Yes. |*| 25 | R: Yes |*| 27 | R: Greatly. Like when you have a dog on a leash. |*| 29 | R: Yes, and it could be that that’s why I got married: to run away from the housework, it could be. |*| 31 | R: From the housework and many other things. I felt that in other ways, I did not have the same rights as my brother, so through marriage I was kind of obtaining my liberty. I can look at it that way |*| 33 | R: Get rid of the leash. (...) |"

I sent my cv to many schools, and I was asked to be interviewed by many schools. But there was one particular school who employed which had a policy, let us say (but it was not written black on white) that they admitted only women, for the reason that it was a tradition at this school. Because it was a nun’s school and they felt that their mind would be more at rest if the whole staff of the school would be female. |*| 3 | R: ... because the students are girls and because I had graduated in exactly the subjects that they required. So without a second thought... I mean, I was employed with them immediately. I have now been working there for about fourteen years and until now... I mean, each time that there was another opportunity for employment, it was always women that were employed. This could have been an advantage to me, because if there had been males who applied for the same job as myself, they were at a disadvantage because of their gender. |*| 5 | R: There’s been little experience of children relating to male teachers. For example, you have a teacher who needs to absent herself due to sick leave... For instance, I remember once there was a teacher who was absent because she underwent an operation in hospital. And because she needed her six weeks of rest, they had employed a male teacher of Physics. So the girls, especially at secondary level, as soon as they saw a young man... It was not a very positive experience for the school. But I cannot tell you what it would have been like should they have employed a male teacher full-time there for a long time. I have no idea how they would have reacted . |*| 7 | R: I think I would give them a chance, but it would depend on the subject. For example for a subject like Personal and Social Development, I would not employ a male teacher because the subjects that they must treat in that subject... But in other subjects, such as the principal competences like Maltese, English, Mathematics, why not? |

But my parents would tell me that it was better to learn something that would be of benefit in the future when I become a mother or a married wife. And so they sent me to learn how to sew. I wished, for example, to learn art, but they did not send me either because they said for the same reason. And then I remember they sent me to do other things related to crafts, for example flower arrangement. I wished a lot also when I was a girl to learn how to ride a bicycle, but I did not learn it - whereas my brother, certain things he used to do then. My brother for example was sent to a private school and they were prepared to pay the fees and the donations, while I was sent to a state school. Now ignore the fact that later on in life I succeeded just the same. There were certain issues, when we were children, that I frequently quarrelled about with my parents. But then, after time passes, I started to realise that certain things... I will do them when I became independent. |

My brother was an altar boy and he was very active. He was the prefect. In F (placename of parish), we also had a vice-prefect of the altar boys. And he had sat for the Latin exam, to go to the Vatican. And he did go. And anyway, I remember when this happened, when my brother had gone to the Vatican. I had really desired to have the same opportunity one day, because it was a really wonderful experience and I could see how great it was because while he was on duty in Rome, my mother and I had visited him. We went to Rome on holiday to see him at work at the Vatican. And we had also visited him in the quarters where they lived behind the Vatican. And anyway, many young men, not men... |*| 3 | R: ... eleven, twelve, that age. And they were having fun, playing. And once, they had one evening, they had played some acting. And they were always being taken to visit places and they even met the Pope. At first they were not going to meet him and then they managed... And anyway, it was a beautiful experience. And besides this, it’s like (...) I always wished (...) I was not good at sports, but I always wished to be a member of a group and I used to see the altar boys, I used to like them, I really liked the idea of altar boys. Every year they had a the feast (vestiture) which was really sweet; something which I really wished to participate in but could not. |*| 5 | R: ... because in those days there were no female altar boys. I mean, nowadays, in some parishes there are. In our parish, there still aren’t. I know it’s not something... Obviously not something very important, but (...) I think that when for the first time in your life there is something which you cannot do because you are a female -or even the other way round... You start, I think, you start... That for the first time, I started questioning sort of (...) that I looked at the church as an institution and I asked sort of \""but why?\"" As a girl, I did not feel rebellious or anything like that but I genuinely asked the question \""why are priests men and why are altar boys men\""? And I started, you start asking. Then obviously you look around you and you discover that there are many more important things where there is a lack of women, like in politics, leadership, business and so on. In Malta especially. But because you are young, you first experience these little things - and almost insignificant, because to be an altar boy is not (...) It’s really something small, sort of. |*| 9 | R: Exactly, it did not have a profound effect, but it had the effect that I started questioning. And then... and then, from something like that, sort of, you become conscious that in the world your gender will make a difference. When you are young, you wouldn’t know; when you are young. |*| 11 | R: exactly exactly |*| 13 | R: ... because when you are young it’s not a question of feeling inferior. You just realise, oh sort of, there are some things which I cannot do. |*| 15 | R: There are differences and sometimes these differences are not natural, as in this case, because obviously nowadays things are changing. But I mean it’s not a profound effect, but something important that you start questioning when you become conscious of such things. |"

And I did. He was very polite even though he did not share my feelings. He was polite, he did not humiliate me. He told me it would be better if we remained friends. And anyway, when I told my friends about it everyone looked shocked, as if I had done a very grave error, like I had lost my dignity, very serious, like I had put myself to ridicule. You know what’s it’s like to lose your dignity. I had shown that I was desperate. My friends told me that in these matters it is the male who has to take the first step. (...) Obviously this had affected me greatly, because when you are sixteen these matters affect you deeply and your life revolves around these matters and this really made me close up within me. At first I thought I had done something with self-confidence; I overcame my introversion. And then, after they told me such things, my friends, and then I became even more introverted. (...) If I had to repeat the same thing now, I won’t look at it so positively because I know that people - not that they are going to judge me, it’s not so serious - but they are going to think that I am desperate, which for me is almost worse than judging me. |*| 2 | (...) |*| 4 | R: Exactly, exactly. |*| 6 | R: No, it’s that when I told my friends... Not all of them, but (...) some of them (there were a few who said I did the right thing), but they told me that the male has to take the first step. Now I don’t think I had done anything desperate. (...) I just spoke to him. But they all told me that the male has to take the first step. But, I thought, who has decided that it should be that way? Because if the male does not take the first step, what am I going to do? Just wait? As long as you keep your dignity, do it in a civil manner, in a calm way. |*| 8 | R: Exactly. It doesn’t make sense because, first of all, it reduces communication to zero and secondly it’s a role imposed by society. In many ways we have managed to eliminate this idea that women should do this and men should do that, but in this matter which in a way is minor, it seems yes it is still there. |*| 9 | (...) |*| 11 | R: Yes, at that time it changed my way of thinking because I decided I would never do such a thing again. But now, looking back, I kind of feel angry against those people. Well, not feel angry, it’s not so serious, but I realise that these things don’t make sense. But at that time, yes. (...) I was seriously affected, you know, at age sixteen it’s the last thing you need. |*| 13 | R: Yes, I think I would do it again, but now I am conditioned. (...) But if I had to give myself some advice, I think yes. Obviously one has to do it in a civil way, in a way in which you keep your dignity, because you have to remember that if you don’t say anything you will be blocking a relationship from developing.

But when boys, a boy stands at a pedestrian crossing, he has to wait longer, both in relation if a woman or a man is driving behind the wheel, anyway boys are more seldom given any priorities and their rights observed. (*| *| ) |*| 3 | R: In my opinion it might be just a polite gesture from men and this factor might stem from upbringing in the family, that a man must let a woman pass first, it might manifest at the pedestrian crossing already mentioned, like sort of sensitivity*| *|  |*| 5 | R.: Maybe it comes from very old ages, such concept, that women have to be protected, have to be cared about, that they maybe are more sensitive, more fragile and for this reason it comes automatically for men – to protect, to care and so. It could be because of this. (*| *| ) |*| 7 | R.: In reality there are different types of women, which maybe also due to upbringing have become sensitive, so helpless in their own mind, but other women are like fighters and they don’t care if somebody lets them cross the street at a crossing or no.(*| *| ) I perceive myself more as a fighter. (*| *| ) |*| 8 | R: That was more a story about the attitude of the opposite sex to me in such everyday situations, but at the same time maybe to demonstrate when I am more vulnerable, more vulnerable than male or so. That is more about the everyday life, where there is no proving of working capabilities, no competitions, about how it happens every day. |*| *|  shown that you are categorized based on sex, that you are more vulnerable? |*| 10 | R.: In reality it doesn’t bother me. In fact I have already used to it, maybe from female teachers, from time at school, (*| *| ) it’s nothing special. |

Then I noticed that teacher’s attitude towards me as a girl is different than against my classmates – boys. It was more in relation to homework or rewriting of tests, when in my opinion I saw some unfairness against me and when I went to clarify things, female teachers treated me more distanced. But when boys went to discuss the same issue with the teacher, they [female teachers] were more forthcoming. And on the opposite - when address a male teacher, he was more forthcoming and listened more to me than to my classmates boys. (*| *| ) Maybe it was such an observation only in my school, as teachers there were mostly female teachers and, yes, it might be because many of the girls in my class weren’t studying, they didn’t have such interest in studies as I had and maybe the teachers perceived me as someone somehow different, and still boys were more favored by them, it was so. (*| *| ) The teachers were stricter in regard to me, maybe sometimes I felt in an unfair manner, more in regard to grades. Because when boys were evaluated they usually received higher grades than me for work of the same quality. (*| *| ) And then I felt deprived and undervalued. And I really didn’t like that during my school days. (*| *| ) |*| 4 | R.: I understood that after all it is unfair and that I know that I am equal with boys – right in regard to education, and that’s why it didn’t bother me. (*| *| ) Because I know that I am not for instance less knowing, and it’s enough with that. (*| *| ) |*| *| ) But this different attitude was based on what? |*| 6 | R.: [It was] directly [associated with evaluation] of  the results [of students’ work] (*| *| ) When talking about this, then the grade in relation to my work was possibly different when in relation to a boy’s work – in one case [it was] more beneficial [with a male teacher] and in another [with a female teacher] maybe not. (*| *| ) It’s maybe somewhere in sub-consciousness of men and women, that the different sex produces a different attitude. Maybe women feel some sort of competition between themselves or something like that. |

But if another girl or I say something, then the professors either agree or try to oppose or disagree less actively with my opinion. (*| *| ) Sometimes you feel less worthy, you feel that you*| *|  well*| *|  that you are not perceived as a competitor, more like they try to be polite because of being polite. (*| *| ) |*| 4 | R.: (*| *| ) If a boy and a girl are involved, then of course more attention is paid to the boy. But if the girl proves herself, then these professors pay more attention to her. As I understood from some of our professors, the girls are more precise and hardworking than boys and because of that if there are any small jobs requiring high precision they are given to girls. (*| *| ) But if there is a bulky work, maybe exactly such where some kind of description or a certain result is required, when something has to be concluded and analyzed – this work is then assigned to boys. But such very scrupulous things with a lot of detail are assigned to girls. (*| *| ) |*| 5 | R: The essence is, that if there is such division and if you don’t like it, you can go and tell it to that certain professor, that I am fed up with doing this, I can, I want to be involved in this or that field and then the professors take you more into account. (*| *| ) |*| *| ) |*| 7 | R.: A girl must prove herself worthy more, yes, so that others don’t think that she cares only about shoes and dresses, then you have to prove yourself.(*| *| ) |*| 9 | R.: In reality it doesn’t bother me, because, me, I like to prove myself, to show that I can, that I am able. (*| *| ) It’s like a test of strength for me. (*| *| ) In students’ life it was more about proving myself as a woman, as an equal [equally capable]. |

Because after graduating from high school where I was learning in a class orientation to Humanities and which I always enjoyed more – literature, languages, at least enjoyed more than math and natural sciences and I was more successful at these subjects, certainly more successful than at natural sciences*| *|  And so I chose, I chose to study law. It came again from the fact of me being a man – I have to do manly things, a manly profession. (*| *| ) And again there has been a strong impact from the side of my father in choosing this profession, because my father is a lawyer too. (*| *| *|  philosophy of life that going to study law - it’s good education, it’s certain security for future, ability to provide for your family. This thinking, because you can always choose maybe a*| *|  profession, where you are very talented in, but at the end you think: yes, I won’t earn much, I won’t be able to maintain my family. And then again this comes up because if I am a man I must be able to provide for my family. And already then at this relatively young age*| *|  being fairly young, you must make a decision that you will be a man and that you won’t be a dreamer forever. <*| *| > And man must always carry this burden on himself and one must choose that manly profession, which can provide all of this. Again, [it is] traditional [view/ perspective], yes. |*| 4 | R.: (*| *| ) Now again after being gone through my studies at university, I have different thoughts – in a manner that as many as we had male students as many, could say a half and a half, were females. And everything flows and everything changes, and it looks like women can more – they take up more leading positions in society and whole. And because it [law] is more such an education for leaders – you have to be a man always in front, the one to talk, the one who protects or at least a very visible person, a person with a strong spine. (*| *| ) To summarize, I think that this is the example of my father – that he has gone this path once already. (*| *| ) |*| 5 | R: Exactly, when the moment comes, when having to choose a certain decision, or at one or another situation, or, when children are going to be willing to take the same decisions or will be asking for an advice or something, then the answers and actions will be very similar not to say the same as my parents did in my case respectively. |*| 7 | R.: One of the important factors I think could be the surroundings, the environment. The surroundings because being raised in Latvia and being raised in my family - this fashion of raising is very similar, very typical this way of raising up [children] in Latvia. And I think if you change the surroundings dramatically, to a very, very warm climate country or to a very prosperous country or to a country which in contrary has a very, very unstable economical situation, then this way of raising up would be different – it could be a factor to change the style of upbringing.  And speaking clear language, like I think, when a man is looked at as a breadwinner, as a man bearing all the heaviness of life, then in such a country with a more unstable economical situation, he would take up on himself even more, maybe would become even more secluded, would do it with clenched teeth. Again if the country would be warmer or more prosperous then this model of behavior could have more freedom. Those are my thoughts and reflections on this topic. |*| 8 | (*| *| ) |*| 9 | R: Well, yes. In relation to my choice of education – even if my interests and my dreams or imaginaries about what I would like to do in my life, what I would like to become, have been somewhat different, I always have been ready to return to what I have chosen, to what was my father’s choice and to how I saw myself as a breadwinner for my family later on – I would choose a profession where you can earn well, if you work a lot, a respectful profession. (*| *| ) And if my father said that he thinks that it would be a good choice, then I heard it like “it’s the only right choice”.  |

I believe that having a figure of a strong man beside me from my very childhood represented by my father, who has always been a ‘man’ with a capital letter in every situation: never being afraid to go and solve his mistakes and consequences, or then, only when he has already failed at it, to search help from professionals etc, he has taught me many useful things for my upcoming life. |*| 3 | R: (*| *| ) Then at some moment I realize, that it is not in my interests, but at the moment when I know that it has to be done, I will not stand aside and ask someone else to come and do it for me, because I*| *|  I think, I know that I am a ‘man’, I know how it’s done, and I will go, because my father has always did like that. (*| *| *| *| ) And as more I grow, as more mature I get, I feel that maybe back then these qualities of my father were unpleasant and irritating me, but these – these are the right qualities.

(*| *| ) |*| 4 | R: And in regard to my sisters if they’ve been brought up in a different way – certainly. Because my sisters have always had a different variant of relationships with father, one where you can negotiate on something, figure out something, keep something in secret, something I never had with my father, father always speaks straight language, never  arranging something, figuring out something, no games, there was always straight talking, talking about business, clear and open. (*| *| ) |*| 5 | R: I think that I could summarize that in few words like that, that it’s such a style of nurture, that you’ve been raised by a man – not only a man of a male sex but you’ve been raised by  a ‘man’. (*| *| ) I am always direct in communication, I am sometimes even too direct and daring. And I try to go and do, and try to be not afraid of consequences. |*| 7 | R.: Yes. Well*| *|  (pause) Well probably the surroundings, probably the surroundings. The surroundings make you understand that this model of fostering is very suited for these surroundings, so that you walk through your life safely and maybe get burnt, but so that it*| *| so that it is the safe way. (*| *| ) so that you really walk through your life having logical (*| *| )  milestones, reference points, something to look back – [like] yes, it was done the right way, next steps [is] correct again and you move somewhere.

Because I can’t imagine myself without any kind of sports, activities requiring competitive spirit. (*| *| ) Now in my opinion it can be observed even more that little boys, for example, lack it, they care only for computers and nothing more and if their parents don’t push him, then maybe he doesn’t have an interest for sports, he won’t go and will never become a man like I was raised to understand what a man is. (*| *| ) The interest was always coming from my side. In the beginning I wanted to train in soccer very much, because it was a very popular sport there when we lived at (city district). But honestly I actually never cared what kind of sports exactly I was involved with. (*| *| ) I was happy as long as it was any sport, as long as I could run and express myself. (*| *| ) |*| 4 | R.:  Because*| *|  Maybe it is in regard to the story I previously told about the way I was raised, then if you have a certain goal, then you just go and you do it. And, and*| *|  Because all of my consciousness and all my beliefs about, what is a lad [a man], comes from the way I was raised and*| *|  And honestly I don’t know how it can be different. (*| *| ) I don’t know either, If I would be a woman or a girl, I*| *|  then most likely I would do those girly things, the traditionally accepted girly things. |*| 6 | R.: I assume, that I would pay more attention to how I dress myself, how I*| *|  how I am perceived by other people. Certainly I would like to cook – don’t know why I get this impression, but I would certainly love to cook and I would be*| *|  it would be like that. Those are just such thoughts about what if I was a girl. (*| *| ) Well, yes, how others see me, in what light, more concentrate on things like cooking, such*| *|  more traditional. I would say traditional. And subsequently*| *|  Traditional in a way, like a traditional education model: that girls like this, boys like that, girls do this and boys do that. I am actually a great supporter of such ideology. (*| *| ) |*| 7 | [B]ut then there some certain things which every man should like. For example sports, maybe it’s a very trivial and worn-out belief, but I think, if you are a man, you like sports. And you*| *|  Maybe you don’t have to be a good player, but you like to watch it, or talk about it or you are interested in something about that sports competition.(*| *| ) Because I believe that sport is one of those fundamental things, basic things forming a man. That is one of such things, like if there would be a voice-changeover during a conversation with a person you can’t see and you would ask a question: “Do you like sport?”, and if you start telling passionately how you like sports, how you like to do sports, watch sports and talk about sports then the other person could with a 90 to 99 % probability suspect that the speaker is male not female, not somebody else. [That is] In such sense. And in my mind because of this way I was raised, the traditional way I was raised I have this love for sports, for activities, I had it all these years, I have it now and I will have it in future. |

And I think in our family we had a fairly classic setting in every way and especially in the men's, women's roles - the same like I think in both of my grandparents' families. Well, that is, of course, that there is a mother - more responsible for home affairs, for cooking, for the clothes and dressing up children, feeding them, and sending them to school. And while the man is more responsible for the...

(...) I have, let’s say, friends among whom I ever see the classical model, where is the guy who takes the classic head of the family role, where a women more so like, or as forced or compelled, accepts the other person's point of view. (...) Specifically in that case, I think, there is a bit of repression of that person, well, of oppression of that girl. Not that something is categorically forbidden for her, but it is more with cues, with such indications, so to speak, the girl is limited. And this is what I see maybe as a problem in this model, that you have imposed sort of your frame to the person and then you want this person to live in this frame.

For me it is an empathy - that it is important to me that this other person feels good, and that it will never be that some sort of things are enforced or the like. This, I think, is important. (...) This kind of equality anticipates that you would not do anything what makes you feel bad, and especially - bad in some gender equality terms of bad – that somebody gives you something just because you're a man or a woman. It seems to me silly, yes. But, I think, it is also likely changing. I am twenty-six years old, I don’t have children yet, after some time hopefully I will have, but I suppose that it is going to be an interesting aspect [in respect to roles when upbringing children] after the moment when the children will appear. |"

It sounds strange, but [nevertheless] - I think the smarter, more educated one are, more open to all sorts of things, such as gender equality, one is. (...) I am twenty-six years old, I don’t have children yet, after some time hopefully I will have, but I suppose that it is going to be an interesting aspect [in respect to roles when upbringing children] after the moment when the children will appear. Then, I think, another series of classical roles related to child rearing. As I have mentioned, [in our society upbringing children is seen as] physiological functions of women, and, of course, [physiology] is one thing that you are not given to [change], it’s a biology [matter], but some sort of things, for example, who takes a parental leave [could be under discussion]. Predominantly women do. But on the other hand, a man can take [a parental leave] also. (...) [Taking parental leave by women] is classically accepted [behavior], is it due to [notions] in society or is it a biological necessity, but in Latvia women mainly do this, as far as I [know]. I have not heard that any man had taken a parental leave, at least not among people I [communicate with]. |*| 7 | R.: No, well*| *|  As about children, yes, children scare me, I mean this entire thing [of upbringing]. And so I would get the feeling that...  I hope that there would be more a female role than a male role. Even though... (...). But looking at the way we [me and my girlfriend] live now, it should not be so that woman does everything. (...) |*| 8 | R: But there is this aspect, I think, that*| *|  (pause) this is about child rearing , I think, that this is the model of society and family saying that women take up more responsibility for children. I think, that is some sort of protection used by men in their life [saying that] it is classically accepted and that it goes like that. I also believe that in some way it should be so [that woman is more responsible for child rearing then man]. (*| *| ) |*| *| ) In a way that all things related to raising [children] are for the mother; not like raising, but all of that like feeding, dressing up, such things related to care are mothers’ responsibility. For dads, I don’t know, checking the grades or educational things, so to say upbringing (*| *| ) At least in my case dad checked more if I fulfill some sort of goals – if we want to finish school, if we want to have grades like this then also we should go for it. (*| *| ) And there are these classical models – you have to finish school, university, you have to get a good job and similar. That is, I think, a thing more related to the male thinking, the rational mind, which tells you, that you must do like that. But, I think, that it perhaps is not always right. (*| *| ) And, I think, returning to the context with children, I [as a father] wouldn’t want to set so strictly, that you must become a doctor or, don’t know, a lawyer, something like that or a physicist, yes. (*| *| ) |*| 11 | R.: (*| *| ) This is the issue, the struggle. On the one hand, I feel, that this clear model of how to do something - is the rational model:  that you finish a good school, certain one for if  you've got good grades in mathematics, enter then [an another educational level]*| *| *| (*| *| ) |*| 12 | R.: Speaking about the role of father, about the second theme – that is something I haven’t experienced yet. And hence I can’t tell definitely how it will be then when it comes, but I know, that there are some certain things which probably will keep for myself from my family. That I also believe that most likely woman must take the parental leave, not the man. And there is that question about the education path – how I see my child, how he should form his life or how I as a father should form his life at least the first years of life. And there is a dilemma, no not dilemma, but a choice between rational path and some kind of emotional path, which is also the classical women – men differentiation. And although this emotional path, that it’s not the rational one, might scare me. But in any case, I think, this opportunity has to be thought over and I wouldn’t want to write it off as a possible variant, because by all means I would wish this person to grow wholesome and interesting not just in one aspect, but in general. |

(*| *| *| ) No, those weren’t ‘Russian times’ anymore, those were nineties – third year or fourth. Well, Mr. husband said that - there is no need to go to work, cause I am not in need of anything. Well that hurt me a lot. And the situation of our family was really like*| *| *| ) |*| 3 | Yes, to stay at home and to raise children. Well it’s kind of right [way to do], if husband is capable to earn enough to keep it up financially. Then one can sit at home. (*| *| ) But  you not only want to meet other people, but also to earn some money to alleviate your life at home. And it’s really depressing, when you*| *|  you have to ask money from another person*| *|  (*| *| ) I don’t have to follow you and ask you for that money. |*| 4 | When I gave birth to my first daughter, I was working, at those times [when the child was] one and a half years old, you had to go to work and the child to the kindergarten. I paid for the kindergarten and the payment of public utilities from my salary, yes, it wasn’t so expensive then, but still*| *|  and for food, clothes for the child. He [the husband] did buy something [spending his money], but he had his own things to do, his “stuff” he was occupied with. (*| *| ) |*| 5 |  I always have tried to be independent, may I say so, my parents have sort of taught me that. And later on, when I got married, I never asked anybody for money, to help me.(*| *| ) |*| *| ) |*| 7 | And then he told me: “Why did you borrow money, why didn’t you ask me?” I said: “Why should I ask?! You have to give me money [without asking]!” And at that moment I had such a feeling, like “why I have told that at all”, when I get cursed for that. (*| *| *| ) And I thought that it’ll be completely the same way in my family: when I will earn, my husband earns, he will bring his salary to me, will give it to me: “Here! See, spend it for that, pay for this, or buy something”. It wasn’t that way!  (*| *| ) Afterwards he kind of gave me something for a while or so.  Other times, when I asked for it, he said: “I have no [money]”. (*| *| ) So, what should I ask then anymore – that was it, I had to get along – [my finances managed] - on my own.(*| *| ) |*| *|  why had he [husband] perceived this situation in such a way?  |*| 9 | R.: [Because he is a] Male. (laughs) (*| *| *| ) He really was very caring and such a... (*| *| ) He lost a lot of money at that time. It’s difficult for a man to accept a situation like that. (*| *| *| ) |*| 10 | Home, children – that was my job. He had earned money, sort of, but later on there was a catastrophic lack of money. (*| *| ) |*| 11 | My oldest daughter lives in civil marriage [common naming for living together without official registration] now also. And the man there is also (stressing) ... the chief. The cock of the walk, so to say. |*| *| ) It was possible for me to go and work, possibly after that to do some things there at a higher level – to be head of a shop or something like that – to grow [in career]. (*| *| *| ) |*| 14 | Well the younger – the middle daughter, as they say, will turn twenty-one - she is in a relationship for a couple of years. Well, she has (stresses) a different temper. All is dependent also from the temper. (*| *| )Well my older daughter is like, who...she also doesn’t like conflicts. Well (sighs)... she strives. (*| *| ) And she argues really seriously. Then I tried not to argue, that’s the thing. It depends on the man; either he goes for a conflict, or he goes for a compromise. |*| *| ) |*| 16 | R.: Nevertheless, yes. Yes. He is like that, she chose him like that. Already when I saw him for the first time, I said straight away, I said: “He is very overbearing, even worse than your father”. (*| *| ) He also has been earning money for himself from a very early age, he is a real man. (*| *| ) His mother has such a fighting, a masculine temper, and he is completely the same. And it’s difficult there. (*| *| ) |*| 17 | [Older daughter] insists [on her position], yes. But other times there are things, that she is some sort of being afraid of... let’s say, in a case of money - to ask something or to insist on her position, she is afraid sometimes, because he holds her. (*| *| ) |*| 18 | You shouldn’t let anyone hurt you. (*| *| *| ) But it [it - not allowing his wife to get a paid job] is offending! Right? That offends your [self-confidence]... And it brings you down... morally. After that a woman gets that... (looking for an appropriate word) that feeling of depression, that you cannot make any decisions yourself.  (*| *| ) Because then you even give it up and don’t try to do anything. |

Yes. Me and my husband, we had a family business: we were offered by the (city municipality’s) social department to deliver thermoses with warm lunch to elderly people.

And then this month passed, I got paid as anticipated, and when it was time to pay the person working in my place, my husband told me, that it wasn’t arranged like that, that I should pay this person from my own resources for his work. (*| *| ) That was a shock! (*| *| )  |*| 9 | R: At any other work-place if I wouldn’t, if it wasn’t a family business, if I would be working at any other place, I would have had a vacation pay and the other person would have been paid too, for working instead of me. And all of a sudden I have to pay by myself for my vacation to the person replacing me. (*| *| ) |*| 10 | R: That was shocking; that absolutely suppressed me down to earth again. (*| *| )  |*| 11 | R: He [R’s husband] could easily afford also to pay, but he said “we hadn’t had such an agreement”. But what does it mean “we hadn’t had such an agreement”? Well, at any other business agree or not – those are employment regulations, no matter am I your wife or not. You have to pay me and that other person, working instead of someone during the vacation time. (*| *| ) |*| 12 | R: That was... a very severe case then, when I understood that it wasn’t normal. (*| *| ) That you can’t work in the same business with close people. (*| *| )  |*| 13 | R: No, see, maybe there are different families. There are businessmen, when both of them are managing the business, and both of them have a voice in decision making. I didn’t have a voice at all. (*| *| )  |*| 14 | R: May be it s also my fault. I don’t know, perhaps I should have been more assertive. But at that moment the shock was so huge, when... and I felt so insulted, by a close person suppressing you because you are [his] wife or because you are a woman, I don’t know, both of them.(...) |*| 16 | R.: It didn’t. Well, I went on working, of course, I went on working. |*| 18 | R.: (pause) Well, at that moment – what year was that? Two-thousand, two-thousand first, second, and also it wasn’t so easy with jobs at that time. Also education was a requisite everywhere. Well, it was advantageous for me to work for him, because... (gives a sigh, looking for an appropriate word)... money stays in family, as he told me. I also believed: yes, it is better that money stays in family [when] I work for a salary. (...) It wasn’t far away from home; after all I had two children, they were schoolgirls already at that time. Then I would have to work eight hours instead of those five. Somehow like this. (*| *| ) |*| 19 | R: That was advantageous for me: more time with family, especially with children, yes, and salary - money wasn’t spent on paying [salary] to someone else. (*| *| )  |*| 20 | R: [It was] like sort of economy, but this economy wasn’t to for my benefit. It was something for my husband’s advantage, but for me it was something like that, like nothing. (*| *| ) The salary wasn’t a big one; it was a tiny salary (laugh). (*| *| )  |*| 21 | R: Although it could have been possible to pay more to such a close person of yours.

Of course, they have been very different. And when back in the beginning of 2000 the boss was a woman I really understood what it means to have a woman as a boss (...) the woman’s mood affected the whole team. (...) As soon as something wasn’t going well in her personal life she lashed out at her employees. (...) And this made me think a lot, because I have said that I think well of women and [there is] that common saying, that women are not good bosses, is not ok. Until that time I thought that it at some level was a stereotype, but then I had my own experience... Totally, men can divide what is their private life, when it is not going well, and what is work. But for her it was all the same. (...)  And I have a very good example when after 5 years I ended up in a team where the main manager was a very young girl  - 25 years old. (...) She was a very positive example in this matter. (...) Of course, I felt that there were moments when because of her relationships, for example, she even at times wanted to cry because of some sort of relationship of hers. But she never dumped it on anyone... the whole team wasn’t suffering because of it. And that is great! But I think that she was more of an exception of the rule. She didn’t attack you. What a woman can do, her strong side, she knows how to regulate the relationship. For example, when I want to say a stronger word, I felt that she straightened out the situation as a woman, great. And I understood that she was doing a good job as a boss. (*| *| ) |*| 3 | Contrary to what I expected, that it seemed she lacked experience, that this could be an issue for her, it wasn’t like that at all. With something womanly of hers... Of course there were men in the team much smarter than her, more than one. But with her womanly sense she made everyone feel good and she also took care of people. (...) But then again, in the last years, which drives me nuts, when bosses are men, but they start acting like women. (...) Like when, for example, their mood takes the upper hand.  |*| 5 | R.: I hadn’t encountered that many situation when a man can blow up – there are even two of them there, just a year ago I had bosses like that – when they are fine with everything, all is ok, but when they are in a bad mood, then they start screaming at the team. (...) To be quite frank, like men say: [women] having their period, and you have to take that into account that in those days there are going to be mood swings. And when men start to have their period like this... Well then it's bad. And it is even worse when it is not the logical sense that clicks on, when he is able to explain himself, but only some sort [of attitude] comes out. These are the kind of men I have encountered lately. (...) |*| 10 | R.: (...)  I know I said in the beginning that I wouldn’t want to have [a woman for a boss]... (...) but I think that it was an exception [the good boss], (...) if I hadn’t had the experience with the two bosses recently, who were [ruled by their mood swings and dumped everything on the employees], well... They knocked down my preconceptions.  |

At this age, now, I feel a lot better than when I was, for example, twenty – thirty. Because finally I have reached that stage when I have experience... and I feel it from the attitude from women, that I am more, maybe the word*| *| interesting” is not the best description, but I feel a much greater feedback than in, let’s say my youth.

One after another, you meet them somewhere and you understand that in reality it’s not about the feelings but about money-driven scheming. (...) They are not really interested in the relationship, feelings and such, it’s just about a man as a form [way/ source] which you can get money from, that’s it. (...) |*| 4 | R.: Very bad. Very bad, because you don’t feel like a man, just a form [thing]... a vehicle for a women to gain something for herself. It was six  - seven years ago when I felt very much like this. (...) |*| 5 | I don’t know why I see it less now. But I don’t think something has changed, because we’re in an economic crisis, so it should be more intense, the fact that women try to solve their problems by getting a man.  I just don’t feel it that much anymore. (...) I reckon that I have sorted myself out. There was a time when things weren’t going that well, I was drinking more then, and now it’s five years that I don’t drink at all. (...)  Maybe it was the same [reason] things weren’t going that well with women, because when you are not right inside [yourself] women feel that intuitively... you know, what they can get from a man, what’s his energy, what can he give. I reckon that that was the problem – me. And now I have sorted everything out, and it’s totally different... I get something completely different from women. Possibly I don’t let women get close to me anymore, that I automatically feel when they are coming and don’t get involved [in relationship]. (*| *| ) |*| 7 | R.: Good attitude is that I always value women more than men. |*| 9 | R.: Because I feel that the quality of women in Latvia is higher than that of men. Women are more conscientious, they have a greater responsibility for who they are, for having children, that they have to raise a family. But men are (whistle) - careless. Men who have a stance, a sense of responsibility, they are very rare. I myself, I can’t often say that: ooo, he’s a great guy, he’s great with his family. I don’t see that. What I see is finding the easy way out. Firstly, they can’t stay with a woman, they go (cheat) left and right. They change their women. In reality, I am not saying that I am... but I like the Christian model in the family so that when you have problems you don’t run away but you overcome those problems. (...) I thought that a family can be created only on those foundations, the Christian model. But now I probably don’t see it as strictly. Well seeing how my mates are I understood that the quality of men is definitely lower. They don’t have as strong  character, they collapse when confronted with problems. (...) |*| 10 | I have been more alone, and I think that you need to get married only when there are feelings, when it is not just for having someone [something] at home – don’t [do hat way]. (...) Just because, you know, you are already this old and you should be thinking about a family. Well you have to do that also... I like the saying*| *| when you can’t do it any other way”. That is a great stage. When you are not there yet, I don’t know... Because I know if I bring someone home before that, sooner or later I will cheat on her. (*| *| ) |*| 12 | R.: Why? Well if I am not that interested in that person. |*| 14 | R.: Yes, if she is there just because, you know, so I would have something. Something you can get anywhere, but in order to live together you need a person you want to stick with. If you don’t feel that, you will cheat. You will want to wander off. That is why I think it is worse when you torture yourself and the other person in that situation. |*| 16 | R.: It’s better not to. (*| *| ) |*| 18 | R.: No, it’s normal for the man to financially take care of his family, what I am talking about are those situation when, let’s say, I financially take care of a woman, in return I want some sort of stability or emotional support... A feeling that there is a point to it all. But if I feel I am not receiving it in return and I am wanted just for the money... I don’t think about those things (...) [w]hen you just feel used, that you are being used, you don’t feel like a man anymore, you feel that you are being used like a thing.  It was very much true at one point. Each and every one [woman I met did it].  |

Yes. (*| *| ) Well, it’s difficult to talk about a man in terms of those times – it was [my] childhood. But the situation was approximately like that in the post war period (*| *| ) that I went to school at the first grade with a rather poor health (*| *| ) But among my classmates I wasn’t one of the strongest. Children often are very cruel, and because of this I had some difficult and painful situations. And because I had some sort of lung disease (*| *| ) I was raised almost in a manner that sun, wind and water are the child’s greatest enemies. (*| *| ) And so till grade seven or so, this physical weakness creates (*| *| ) a very degrading awareness which makes a person weak and un-enterprising. For some reason I don’t even know it happened so (*| *| *| ) In time of some three or four years from a boy, whom everybody could treat in a bad way and ignore, I became a teenager, to whom some two or three other boys can do no harm. And as it later came out it was a great stimulus for my self-esteem as well as for feeling of security in life. But unfortunately without the understanding of the order of things in life or without the understanding that spiritual world is more important than physical, great arrogance arises in man, pride of his physical strength, unfortunately also in relation to women, sometimes. They [men] say “well they [women] are there much weaker”. (*| *| ) |*| 3 | R.: That was some kind of, I don’t know, some kind of a ‘click’: “Listen, it will not go like that, this thing. Well, you are not made to be pushed aside, just like this*| *| ” |*| *| ) |*| 5 | R.: (*| *| ) There are many painful situations causing injury*| *| (*| *| ) They say something insulting, sometime they punch you unfairly*| *|  (*| *| ) In particular, this happens when it's in a crowd, or as we say today in the herd. It manifests usually in the crowd. People like always want - it is not a very good feature - but he wants, the man wants others - especially if he’s in a teenage age, wants girls watching him with delight in their eyes. But that is another question. Because if you are looked at just because you have the muscles, then there is no point in it. (...) Later I went to mountaineering. And I have some kind of champion titles - local, but still [I have]. And it all led to...  it all again later created a very wicked pride, which subsequently caused problems.(...) Well, might say, star disease in my own local village. (...) You have to develop yourself both physically and (...) you have to develop your mental/spiritual side. And it all has to be balanced. (*| *| )  |*| *| ) had an accent on body? |*| 7 | R.: Well, that, that thought – it is in general, it goes through all ages – if you are a man you have to lift this [weight]. This thought goes through all. It is a good thought. You have to lift it, yes. (*| *| ) Unfortunately men cannot protect this quality. Sometimes  - after acquiring this quality  - they spend it by drinking and smoking. And then they lose it and then it’s over. |

But looking back, to remember one here on the spot is quite hard. It’s quite hard to answer this question because it is impossible to imagine what would the situation be like if I were a woman... (...) The problem is that when men of my age here, in this part of the world have been raised, spent their childhood and youth years in what we call soviet ideology... (...) But looking at life I remember myself as a man, when the necessity for the combination of physical strength and mind manifested itself, when I ended up again in the environment where I was born and bred, namely, the countryside. Where it turned out that you need both your strength [as a man] and in the new, independent system, which hadn’t been completely sorted out, special mind skills, almost a womanly intuition, in order to find the correct path, because the laws were being developed, you had to feed the family, you have your past [previous family], and you had nothing... And the simple [way] - if I work and if someone will show me what to do, they’ll pay me, which was true in the soviet system, -  wasn’t true anymore [under the independent system]. And so a great dexterity was needed in order to hang on. How it turned out is another question completely. (*| *| ) |*| 4 | R: And the women in modern days when we talk about equality but we don’t talk about what is the responsibility of each separately [male/female roles]. (...) Based on this ideological foundation a man often runs into the difficulty of understanding what is that he has to do. It is sort of asked from him to dig [physical work] but it is not enough – he needs to think and love and feel, and protect. And the physical strength alone is often not sufficient. And then the problem of not knowing how to keep your family together appeared. (...) |*| 5 | R: But the thing is if a woman in the end raises the children, at least when they are young, they need the woman’s love, therefore, the woman needs the protective and taking care of the family sort of love from the man, economically, physically, if the [physical] is needed, as well as the mentally. (*| *| ) And the soviet man couldn’t handle the mental/spiritual part of it.  |*| 7 | R.: Of course myself. I can’t speak on behalf of everyone. (...) |*| 8 | R.: Well is what like that: when I paid most of my attention to the physical work and strength but I forgot that I have to dedicate time, take time off, to analyze the whole situation, to create the sense of security for the woman. Because if a man comes home tired from the physical work and more than that [doesn’t give anything else to the woman, family] he really cannot, then the final [result] isn’t enough. And with the bad economic climate in the country, the man’s physical work isn’t sufficient, he need to understand mentally/spiritually if he really needed to do the physical work. Maybe he needed to go to learn something for a month, so he could work in something else. (...) |*| 9 | R.: It is the question of spiritual values, they should be in the first place [in the male identity] over material values, including physical, carnal and all the others.  |*| 11 | R.: Yes. It is relevant to men and to raising the children. It is better when he [man, father] decides it. Because then the woman can dedicate herself completely to what we call the heat of a family’s hearth. |

(*| *| ) Because girls, the mature girls*| *|  (*| *| )  then it [being a mature girl] was treated with a minus sign, with a negative touch. And then I became like the others, they started to catch up with me respectively, they also got their periods starting after several years, I was very happy because I wasn’t different from the other girls anymore. (*| *| *|  Although nothing like that [attitude towards being a woman] happened at home, but neither anybody tried to convince me that everything is ok. I grew with great respect to work of men. Although both of my parents had higher education, (*| *| ) but somehow my mama always told such things like: that’s a work for men, that’s like it. (*| *| ) Yes. And in principle it, I always thought: “Ehh, If I were a boy, it would be better”. And that*| *|  As a result I got some kind of complexes, as you call them now, which ones I could handle with difficulties. I joined the faculty of physics and mathematics (...) That subject [just] wasn’t mine. (*| *| ) I studied just good, And I could handle it, but it wasn’t physics I cared about. I cared about something else – I wanted to be like a boy. (*| *| ) |*| 3 | And there I found myself yet in another situation - there really were only boys in my group. And in group of physics. And I stayed there only thanks to the very good professor I had, who taught very well and not because I was a very good physicist. And when there was a choice to make – what to do next, I had a child at that moment already. And I graduated a little later. That was the moment, when I understood, that - again with a minus sign - I won’t be able to handle science as a woman. (*| *| ) |*| 4 | And my graduation work supervisor asked me to work at the university with him. (*| *| ) My daughter slept badly, science was of little or no interest for me*| *|  I understood that I won’t become a great scientist*| *|  I had difficulties with doing experiments. That again was the time when I got convicted, that women*| *|  that young men do better. They studied worse, but got better results in science. (*| *| ) |*| 5 | Then I found myself for the first time and, it seems, it was feminine perhaps. (*| *| ) It started editing – I worked at (name of institute), we had our scientific proceedings. And I worked there because I went to a Russian school and I knew Russian very good. (*| *| ) |*| 6 | Yes, then I felt like being at the right spot. So it was. Finally those pluses appeared. (*| *| ) I was connected to science. I sort of assisted. But we had very strange atmosphere in our institute. (*| *| ) We had predominant male chauvinism. And this chauvinism had penetrated me so much already from study years – that it really is so, that men are superior and women not. (*| *| ) I didn’t even think [about it].(*| *| *| ) That’s why I tell you, it’s funny, those such teenage emotional experiences [of mine], but keep in mind that [it was] at Soviet times (*| *| ) [and] there were no advices, not psychological, nor feminine, nor any. At home we didn’t discuss such things [of woman's position] either, no, somehow didn’t. And that’s why I have such crippled beliefs. But when I understood that I am not worse, I wanted to prove that I as a women -  I understand things not like worse but even much better. And then I left the institute, because I knew*| *|  I wondered how they don’t understand that we are no more dependent from Moscow, that Moscow won’t give money anymore and that science will have no money. [I knew] that I must search for a solution on my own. (*| *| ) |*| 7 | And then I started to prove myself. It wasn’t important to prove it to them. It was important to prove myself that I can handle my life. And that was year ninety one and now we have year two thousand and eleven, right -  and in those twenty years what different things I have done! I understood that as a woman I am much stronger in many things. And then the pluses started. (*| *| ) |*| *| ) Until I finally understood and life convinced me that the fact that I am a woman is a great joy for me. First of all I gave birth to children (*| *| ) it can’t be compared to anything, right. Second – I proved myself as a women (*| *| *| ) |*| 9 | I have daughters. (*| *| ) Daughters have handled their lives, not good, but perfect! They realized everything I didn’t. And all the time I tried, not so much with daughters but more with my elder granddaughters, especially granddaughters, to influence them in a way that they should receive what I didn’t – I studied well, but nobody praised me. I tell them all the time (*| *| ) that I am proud of them, that they are the most beautiful, smartest, that they will always handle everything and that I rely on them a lot and believe that everything will work out for them. And it is so! (*| *| ) It is so. My daughters have realized themselves wonderfully in both - career and family life. Not without difficulties, like with the eldest daughter, but really great. (*| *| ) Yes. They are [fulfilled themselves] like women, like personalities. |

I remember myself from a very young age, from age of three and even when I was still in a pram. And as I was born during war it was a wonder on its own. (laughs) Then attitude towards me was very positive, there were very few children that time, when I was very little. (*| *| ) And then I got in to a contradiction. (*| *| ) Our communal flat wasn’t very big, but we were two families in it: us – with father, mama and brother - and our neighbors, [who] had two, they weren’t brothers, but two young men and their mother and father. One of those young men was*| *|  I remember when they arrived; he was at the age of thirteen. I was three years old. So he was quite older than I was. But he was an after-war child, he started working early.  I don’t know about how many years of education he had or hadn’t. He was very handsome. As I didn’t attend a kindergarten and stayed at home alone often – I went to the neighbors. That was a common thing. And I sat at his lap and*| *|  And there were no pantyhoses at that time, not any at all, we wore socks, and socks were held by a rubber band. And he, my neighbor, had a habit of holding his hand on my leg and he somehow slipped with his hand under my panties. I didn’t like it, but I wanted to visit them a lot, because there was no other place to amuse yourself. It repeated often. I don’t know how often, but [it occurred] repeatedly. Afterwards somehow I grew up, started to go to school and didn’t go there anymore and didn’t sit on the lap. But always since then and now more than sixty years have passed, I knew, that I can’t talk about it. Now I understand why I thought so. Then I couldn’t formulate it, because I [I was a child, and] a child is a child. [I didn’t think] why I can’t [speak about it]. But it was a taboo. I couldn’t speak about it. Now I could explain it. And that how I will explain it now, only proves, that I did right by not telling it. If I would have told, it would create a thousand and one problems. We didn’t have where [to go], we couldn’t have a fight with the neighbors, we couldn’t move to another place and*| *|  It would ruin the relationships. I would be guilty. And everybody would say that I have either made it up in my fantasy and it actually never happened or that I am a spoiled child –at such age already speaking about such things, or something like that. In any situation I wouldn’t gain from it. And such things like – well, this sexual harassment and so on, that – no one spoke about things like that. And by the way I really was very little. Yes, I didn’t go to school yet*| *|  I remember that very well. And I liked that he is older. And he also played with me, talked, in other ways he was very nice to me. And*| *|  But that was a moment when I realized, that I*| *|  that there are certain things*| *|  that I have to keep silent and that it [that things] is not good. (*| *| ) |*| 4 | R.: Yes! I didn’t love my body. I didn’t love my body. I disliked everything in relation to body. (*| *| ) Well, I don’t know if it’s [influence, impact] of the century? Well, partially it is. Because simply this result, this notion, it was from my very early age*| *|  from early childhood injected somewhere – well, in sub-consciousness in the beginning, later it formed in consciousness, this negative attitude towards your body, towards everything related the sexual side. To be honest, no one told me how babies are made*| *|  (*| *| ) I didn’t have the smallest clue about how it is in reality, what and where, and how! But as my sister studied at the faculty of medicine I stealthy read all of her books. So, somehow I got to understand something, but I couldn’t talk it over with somebody, I had such a crippled understanding. But in any case I wasn’t ready for real life, for real relationships. (*| *| ) |*| *| . that you must keep silent and suffer in silence, right? |*| 6 | R.: Yes, yes. For me, yes. One hundred percent! Yes, one hundred percent! You formulated it right. Yes. Yes.

I remember myself from a very young age, from age of three and even when I was still in a pram. (*| *| ) When I was loved and somehow like that, then in a few years it all turned absolutely different, not in a moment, little by little. (*| *| ) Another moment which influenced me, then I was even younger, when we went together with my mama went to a bathhouse. It was only once. My mama didn’t take me to bathhouses anymore. I was some three or four years old and I got scared there. I now remember that it was dark there, steam and naked women and I disliked that very much. (*| *| ) Again it was another time when I understood that everything related to body or sex, that all of that is forbidden, dirty and bad. Well the same in relation to menstruations, which I experienced it already very  early and I thought that I am going to lose all of my blood. (*| *| ) |*| 4 | R. Yes, I didn’t love my body. I didn’t love my body. I disliked everything in relation to body. (*| *| ) |*| 6 | R.: Yes! I was watching at myself in the minor and there was nothing what would seem beautiful about me. (*| *| ) But then it seemed to me, I had such feelings that all in my life could be different if I would be a boy. I didn’t like anything about me. I was developing very quickly. I disliked that I had breasts already, and all the things*| *|  During all the school years I didn’t go to sports classes, because (*| *| ) girls were laughing at me that I have breasts already. I used to tie a kerchief around them to flatten them. And all of that, all of it together made me [feel]*| *|  as a result [of this experience] I developed those psychological complexes, that all are associated with femininity - that I am ugly, that all of it is wrong. (*| *| ) |*| 7 | That happened just one other time when I thought “Well yes, now I look like an old aunty!”. I went for the first time to a gynecologist, she told me exactly the same: “Oh, you look like would be thirty already*| *| ” – in addition I was still a girl then, (*| *| ) I didn’t know what to do – to run out of the office or what. As a result I wasn’t cured completely. Because that was the attitude! It was the same all the time onwards.[Attitude was all] the same when I was giving birth to my children –  like to a piece of meat. Well. (*| *| ) |*| *| ) That’s it, that stems from all around, all the surroundings make you feel about your female health and body that it is bad, makes you to be in disharmony with yourself. (*| *| ) |*| 9 | R.: (*| *| ) Yes, in disharmony with yourself. (*| *| ) But simply I didn’t have the time to think, I had to finish university, I had to give birth to a child. Then the femininity at all - those moments - I was too busy, I didn’t think about it. But time passed and the second child came. And I became a little more chubby and I was unhappy with myself again. And even before that, and after I tried to compensate for it somehow – I regularly started to attend various groups of gymnastics, well as regular as I could; swimming in the pool. (*| *| ) I started to pay attention to things I ignored before – to have straight back, to have a different way of walking. The things I should have done at the age of ten to twenty I did in between thirty and forty. (*| *| ) |*| 11 | R.: To look good as a woman (*| *| ) because of my husband, because of my colleagues, male colleagues, yes, because of all. I returned to the team after I had quite a long leave – I became pregnant at thirty and stayed home for three years with my child. I want to look good - as a woman. (*| *| ) Then I started to pay more attention to such things, I never did before, started painting nails, some sort of makeup, I didn’t do that before.(*| *| ) But then after a great delay these priorities then appeared for me. (*| *| ) |*| 13 | R.: Yes. Yes. And then you feel great. Because I had results! And then the feeling was great. And I remember it as a very good time at the age in between thirty and forty, in spite of many personal and social life problems, because I finally started to feel like a woman. (*| *| ) Because it also isn’t normal that it takes so long to get to this. For some time it also was rather a very serious accomplishment for me after the age of forty. But it is also so interesting, that I didn’t tell it to anyone. (laughs) |

Then I get the feeling that I really should life up to that expectation and it gives me the idea that I really should make a lot of money. Because later on, I will have to be the men who can support his family and that’s the idea I get. I don’t fully agree with this, but it is a constant pressure on me. This is also being confirmed lately by my mother when she said recently – my sister left the house a year and a half ago – and my mother is still whashing her clothes. I told my mother: ‘When I leave home, you also have to wash my clothes for a year and a half because fair is fair’. My mum replies: ‘No, because I would not liketo take over the job of your girlfriend’. Than I think:’ For god’s sake!’ But is is a part of our family: a women should be in charge of the household and a men should go out to work and take care that everything is financially supported, etc. For me this is in line with what I was told during my youth: a boy needs to be a boy and do his thing, and a girl needs to be a girl and should cooc and wash the clothes aparently. |*| 3 | ... |*| 4 | R: (the respondent explain how he is surounded  in his study group by mainly women). |*| 5 | That makes me want to prove my masculinity more. Since I am verbally strong, I tend to start discussing why a men should have certain advantages over women. In the same vain I could even argue that a man should earn more than a women. I have a whole theory about this but I will not expand on that now. |*| 7 | R: If a company hires a man of 24 with a certain curriculum and certain competences and a women with exactly the same value, than obviously you do not run the risc that the man will become pregnant and with the women you do. If you look at your wage as being the acumulation of the past, the present and the future of you experience, your competences at this moment and in the future, than in the future of the women there is the possibility to – generally speaking – become pregnant.This means that the employer has to replace her during a certain period and this means an additional cost. This means that an employer who is faced with a men and women on equal footing, will chose the men who is more labour stable and so the law of  demand and supply comes into play. As a women you should lower your price when entering the market. Theoretically, if you demand the same wage, you will become more and more unemployed than men and so equalisation of wages... They say: ‘ the same wage for the same work’ but that is if you only look at the present. They don’t look at the past and I think that if you look at the past, you should also look at the present and the future. Than you have the possibility with women... that’s a bit the theory. I know that I ... |*| 11 | R: I think it is logic, but not fair. But the world in general is not always a fair place. I can imagine that women are not happy about this, but it is something you should just accept as it is. It is the way society works. So it is rather neutral as such, but it has rather unfair consequences. Je can try to oppose this but then you risc creating an artificial situation that will create other problems like maybe a hgher unemployement rate among women and than maybe you will... The next step is than maybe quota to get as many men as women and that will cause problems because than maybe men who are competent or more competent than women will not get employed because of a quota.  |

Yes, it just continued that way, and I think that at the time I didn’t think it was a problem, but I did find it a pity. Later on, when I got older – the last years of secondary school – my niece and nephew became real friends and then ithappened that my sister – I have a sister – that my sister got along so well with 3 of my nieces and me as well, but they always walked together and I followed behind. They went to play ‘spy’ with the 4 of them and so my sister went to my aunt’s house to play spy  and I wasn’t invited, poor me (smiles). And then they went on holidays a couple ot times. At a certain time they even went to the USA and my sister could joint them and my aunt – who is rather rich – paid everything for my sister and poor me couldn’t go along. At home we are not very... we are not very rich so my parents are no travellers. So, being able to do a trip, for me this was: ‘waw, a trip to Corfu’, or some other destination. My sister could join them a couple of years ... What was I going to say about this?... |*| 5 | R: yes, and that feeling came back many times. It even made me feel revengeful and I got to a point where I closed down on them, I did not want to be involved with them anymore. They had become friends, but I did not want that friendship anymore. That I had a feeling that I was a boy. ... |*| 7 | R: Yes, the girls amongst themselves.... |

In the beginning this was very charming. In the beginning when we met and got married, in those days people who worked for TV were something. You wanted to go out with them. In those days there was always something going on in town. And we were always there (to film it), (respondent talks about the different events that they filmed). But at a certain moment, TV becomes more common. And in the beginning of the 70 she had 3 children. In the beginning my brother was very eager to come and babysit. He would even have paid our cinema, because this gave him the change of coming to our place with his girlfriend. But at a certain point he got married himself and the situation changed. So it happened, you have to go somewhere to shoot something and you hang around the place afterwards. In the end this started to cause friction. My wife didn’t feel involved anymore. It wasn’t easy anymore for her to join in all these events.  |*| 7 | R: Yes, because of the children but also because the job itself started to change. On Saturdays I would drop her off at a friends’ place while I went off to work. For me it wasn’t a problem, but they didn’t like it. So in the end it created friction. And in the end this friction turns into suspicion: ‘ Yes, but you said you would be home by 7?’ ‘Yes, but afterwards we still had to run one interview at the home of the director’. All of it was true and we had the advantage that she knew the people involved, they would come and visit us at home, but still. The suspicion started to grow and this turned very bad. But our divorce did not have anything to do with the fact that we grew up in separate worlds. |*| 8 |*| *|  |*| 9 | R: By that time she had quit her job and was at home with the children? So I can imagine that she lost the clamorous perspective of the early days. She did join once in a while, but only on specific events. Also, you alienate. First I was working as an employee, but later as a free lancer, so you get to know other people. Then I started to make movies. A movie is really like seasonal labor in the old days: you would leave in the morning, but you would not know when you would get back. In those days it was like that: we planned to shoot until 6, but that became 7, became 8, became 9. And this fuelled the suspicion and jealousy. It is enough that you get some rain during the day to postpone the work for a couple of hours. So, I worked with other people, that she did not know very well and jealousy is killing any relationship. In the end I felt bad every time I left.  |*| 10 |*| *|  |*| 12 | R: I don’t think it influenced the relationship with my children up to the point of the divorce. To be honest, in between my work I often was at home 3 or 4 days. So I was involved in their school, the girls went to a certain school that involves the parents a lot. With regards to the children, the divorce was a really pivotal moment. My wife played a tough game at that point and I didn’t see my children for some years.  |*| 14 | R: Yes, that is what happened. That is when you realize that your legal right to see the children is relative indeed!. It looks fine, but in reality, when I went to pick them up, they always had activities to do: a pony-camp, a youth movement camp, etc; Anything was better than being with their father. I still remember at a certain point, yes, this is very hard on you. I had a good talk about it with my sister in law. She said: ‘Get over it! They will come back!’ and that is indeed what happened. My wife married again*| *|  |*| 16 | R: Well, that must have been every fortnight I guess. A weekend. |*| 18 | R: Yes, and during the holidays you had to arrange it, either Christmas or Easter holidays and the summer holiday would need to be divided. But it never worked that way. You still feel it. At a certain point – when must that have been – my eldest daughter was thrown out of her house. I said: ‘hold on! What is going on here?’ She still lived in town A at the time, so I went there. Well, she had a boyfriend and her mother didn’t like the boyfriend. In the mean time my ex-wife had married again and also her new husband didn’t like the boyfriend. So, I talked to my daughter, she was working already at the time. She had not studied a lot, but she was adorable. I said: ‘Ok, so I will take the responsibility, let’s look for an apartment!’. I knew her boyfriend because also his father came from the same town as me. My daughter and (future) son in law showed me a letter written by my ex-wife in which she said that she couldn’t marry the boyfriend because he was not prestigious enough. That same son in law has been the director of a bank for the past 10 years, so that is not too bad when it comes to prestigious! And saying this to her daughter who had only gone to school until she was 14 or 16 with some extra schooling in French, is not very wise. We found an apartment and arranged everything and I told them that I would sign for the caution. And then there was a change again when their first son was born. So, it wasn’t that she had to get married, but when the son was born all of a sudden my ex-wife wanted the party at her place, that was the only time that I have been to her place. She doesn’t live too far from here. So then it changed. And so the daughter and son in law- because by that time they had married – were welcome again. From that moment my relationship with my two other children got a lot better as well.  |*| 20 | R: Yes, and also with my grand children I have a very good contact.  |

So I say: the pivotal point was the army service, that was still a 100% men’s world. Then you have a bit of a ‘grey change period’. The army service, then you get married.  |*| 4 | R: My wife worked, so it was normal from the beginning that the household would be*| *|  actually we learned to run the household together. It was like that: she had it from her mother. Her parents had a business of their own, so her mother had once in a while, a housekeeper, but we decided together to do it.  |*| 6 | R: yes, but at the same time this also had to do with the – I even put this on facebook yesterday – with the fact that we were renting an apartment for 10.000 Belgian Franks and wanted to buy a house.  |*| 7 |*| *| . |*| 8 | R: And also I thought it was normal that when she was pregnant – she had 2 children in the same year: a son born in January and a daughter born in December. From that moment on she stayed at home. The youngest daughter, was born 5 years later. At that point she also stayed at home  because she was working with a radiologist and from the moment that she was pregnant, she wasn’t allowed to work anymore. Nut in those days that was normal. I never had a 9 to 5 job. You left in the morning and you didn’t have the faintest idea of when you would get home at night. Except programs for ‘boer and tuinder’ those had strict working hours. But at the same time I could also easily be at home for two days, do the shopping, etc. At the time we got divorced, this was a big advantage, at least I could take care of myself and didn’t have to buy a cookbook in order to get food.  |*| 10 | R: Yes, because of the fact that she worked with a radiologist, so from the moment she was pregnant it was not allowed anymore. She had to take maternity leave, the risc was too high. So she stayed at home and soon she was pregnant again, so she resigned. Yes, automatically , I speak of the year ’66 now. Later on she started to work again but that was when the youngest one started primary school. That was very normal in those days. The only thing that really bothered me  was thae fact that my mother and mother in law always had to interfere in our lives. Right from the start. They tought that was normal as well. I never liked it and never got used to it. Even now I still hate it when people tell me what to do.  |*| 11 |*| *|  |*| 13 | R: yes, as yyou say, they thought is was the usual thing to do. They thought it was their responsibility. As a mother you have to cut the umbilical cord again. That is the same thing until the first children are born. That is the wxay it is, the matriarchal system. My mother already had three grandchildren when my children were born, but for my mother in law, it were her first grandchildren. That is the matriarchal system that kick in, they feel they have to mother you.  |*| 15 | R: yes, you often hear this, so in the fringes: ‘the men had a lot of outward power, but it was my mother who decided what to do with the money!’. That is what you hear afterwards. When you are a lot older, you realize that your father never bothered about those things. When he retired he didn’t even know how much he earned. Because my mother – in those days they used checks – she took it to the bank and paid all the bills. She gained a lot of authority and that was considered normal. I think it depends on the character, but maybe also because I was the eldest son? That was another difference: a daughter was being married OFF TO, she would leave the house. Whereas a son, he would bring a wife into the family. It used to be that way on the farm and those agricultural traditions continued to stay alive long after the farms were gone. The mentality persisted. And you still often hear: Outwardly the men is the boss, but if you close the front door, the women is the boss.  |*| 17 | R: yes, maybe the challenge was bigger. If we had a chance of playing hide and seek with the girls – surely our hormones were working as well – the challenge was much bigger. But, yes, when I look at my grandson now. He turned 16 last week. He has a girlfriend sonce last year already. I don’t have anything against this. I think it is charming.*| *| Of course we had to learn  a lot of things through trial and error. And in retrospect you realize: we also made mistakes. Just maybe because  - like Don Quichot – we were living at a pivotal point in time in between 2 systems. You should not forget, that we lived through the war. And the years after the war, you got caught in a strong current: everything was possible. Surely the ’60. You grow up, you get married, that’s the evolution you live through.  |

In the family where I grew up, even with my grandparents: the husband worked and the wife stayed at home. My mother, she went to a school where she learned embroidery and household stuff. It was really oriented towards doing the household. The only thing that was common (for boys and girls) was pre-school. There was a nunnery school and that was mixed in pre-school but from primary school onwards, it was sex segregated: boys on one side of the village and girls on the other side of the village. It might be a coincidence, but that was even done in church: boys on one side and girls on the other. |*| 3 |*| *|  |*| 4 | R: I just want to say: we had found a nice excuse that we could use for years: in the neighboring village there was a (religious) cave and we used to go there every fortnight. They always agreed that we could do that. Maybe they thought we had a calling, but in fact the girls youth movement used to come there too. So that was our first contact (with girls) all very nice. |*| 5 |*| *|  |*| 6 | R: It was all very normal, not questioned, as much as I can remember: as a boy you did not have to help in the household. You did have to work in the garden, like getting potatoes. We had a small vegetable garden. So they would ask: go and get some potatoes. But peeling the potatoes? No, I never did that. I only did that for the first time when I went to the army. It was ‘not done’ for a boy to do things in the household. And my mother continued this long after we were married. When we used to go and visit her, the girls had to go to the kitchen and the boys could go and chat a bit and shouldn’t go to the kitchen. I used to say at times: ‘Let me help a bit!’, but no, no, no way I could. Of course this did give them the chance to gossip a bit behind our back, so looking back I can see how it could be useful, but that fact that it was segregated was always considered normal.  |*| 7 |*| *|  |*| 8 | R: My father held a speech and he talked about my grandmother as always having been ‘the supporting act of my grandfather’.*| *|  My father had done his education in French and used to talk with a dialect. And he always spoke very firm and he said: ‘Times have even changed so much that nowadays we are being judged and sentenced by women!’ This goes to show that he still was struggling with these changes. Women should stay at home according to him. Nevertheless, there was already a female major in town. So that evolution got going already, but clearly went against his nature. |*| 9 |*| *|  |*| 10 | R: I just want to say, before you go to the army, you live in completely separate worlds. I used to read anything that I could get my hands on, also the girls books that belonged to my eldest sister. The books were: ‘Joop Ter Uil’ books, I have always been in love with Joop ter Uil. I think that for the rest of my live I looked for a Joop Ter Uil type of women! I don’t think I chose those books because of their literary qualities, but surely they gave me some insight into the feminine world. I just want to say it was: ‘Joop ter Uil in love’, ‘Joop Ter Uil engaged’, ‘Joop Ter Uil married’ and ‘Joop Ter Uil as a mother’. I read all of it. Also ‘Stijfkopke’, that was an analogy, based on the same theme. That was our only access to the women’s world. Yes, and I can remember, where we were living, in the bathroom. On Saturdays we would take baths. There was a big metal tub that was filled with hot water from the kettle. First the little ones would take a bath, then they got a biscuit and cup of tea and had to listen to the radio. Than the bigger ones took a bath. But that was very strict. I think I never ever saw my elder sister – an even my younger sister for that matter- naked. Never in my life. It also didn’t matter. That was the way things were. I think it was part of the upbringing. You didn’t even want to see that. It was such a normal part of upbringing. You are in two different worlds and those worlds meet.*| *|  |*| 12 | R: Yes, it used to be very symbolic even. Now those traditions have scaled down. But in those days, the groom would go and get his bride. The father would say: ‘Yes, you can have her!’ and you went all together to the city hall and the church and afterwards you could take her home. And only at that point did the life together start. Because before that point, making love,*| *|  First of all, every time I had to get back home in time with the last tram because we were living out of town. So going out late is something I only learned when I was in the army. To my disgrace! Even the time when I was dating my future wife, we had to take the last tram home at quarter to 12. And we behaved very properly on the tram. On the back seat of a car you could have tried something, but not in a tram. It was unheared of. Although, I dived a bit into our family history and found out that that a lot of them HAD to get married.  |*| 14 | R: Yes, my father said: when the fair is in town*| *|  |*| 16 | R: Yes, because one time*| *|  |*| 18 | R: No, never said but afterwards it was clear that there were no 9 months between the marriage and the birth of the child.  |

I worked on the butchery counter so I was with the butchers. They were mostly men; the only women who worked there were refilling shelves and people managing, so to say, were only men. I was certainly treated differently, because even at the level of the work, there were lots of little allusions, just little things, always on a joky level until the moment when*| *|  At the first I found it funny, it was part of having a “little game” but it was nice, friendly, I could have done the same with friends*| *| 3 | (...)  |*| 4 | R: At first it was okay, it was sort of... er, er, wait a moment for me to remind, yeah... “we can go and have a drink if you like” and stuff [incomprehensible word] or small reflections as you would do with friends if I wear a low neckline, well it was not the case, but if I was wearing a low neckline, [they would say] \""oh you put a low neckline\"" or stuff like that. At first it’s maybe little digs, little jokes, it’s not... it’s nothing very serious. Nothing you could take offence at. Not harassment or anything. It was later, at last they came out with: “Let’s go into the back room for a while.” At that, I went totally white! I realised that it wasn’t just nice, it was things that had a dimension that I never suspected at that time. Because I was 19 years old, and I wasn’t especially experienced with that sort of thing. So I was really pfff...  |*| 6 | R: Yes, yes, I probably said something, sort of pfff, I don't know. Yes, I reacted but I can’t say exactly how any more. Maybe when someone told me... about smacking... They came out with something about smacking. They said to me “Oh but you must try a smack on the bottom, I swear, you might like it.” And I was like this: “Oh no, that’s not really my thing.” But there are things*| *|  that were another time when it went too far. I felt it wasn’t healthy. |*| 7 | (...) |*| 8 | R: But I think that it’s clear that there is always an ambiguity, often an ambiguity between men and women and so clearly in working life it is not easy to manage this difference. It’s really stupid but it’s a stereotype, or a hidden stereotype, but a male boss who goes to thank his workers and puts his hand on their shoulder and says \""nice work\"" and so on – that would be seen as natural. If it’s someone charismatic, no one would worry. But if a woman did that, it would be seen totally differently. |*| 10 | R: But it's just that... actually it's really all of a... I don't know how to explain but it is... In the work environment, a woman is much stronger than a man. She has to show that she’s stricter, much more*| *|  because women also have a maternal side, and there a barrier has to be put up. Whereas a man doesn’t have this maternal side, so he can just show what might be called minor gestures. It would not be interpreted differently because he is a man. It is just the reward for good work as he would do with his child by saying \""well done son.\"" So it's different. While woman are more... It will be different. Yeah... It would be completely different... |*| 11 | (...) |*| 14 | R: Of course a man has naturally more autority than a woman. Because – I don’t know if it’s because of this – women have a female side that is connected with motherhood, and so is more sensitive. It’s clear*| *|  What’s more, male qualities are not seen as appropriate for a woman. When a man wants to get ahead (...) people say there’s someone enterprising, someone who wants to succeed, make a career*| *|  while a woman would straightaway be seen as (*| *| ) ah at work, she’s a bitch. If she fights her corner people take it badly. Whereas with a man they say okay, he wants to succeed – that is clear to me. |"

At the start it’s true that my being a girl did make things a bit*| *|  difficult, and they were a bit doubtful. So the temp agency that had to take on the people rang up and said: “Listen, it’s somebody’s sister”. And I told them: “Listen, I went to the same school as my little brother, so if he knows how to do it, I know how to do it. Apart maybe from carrying heavy things.” So in the end they took me and it all turned out well because I gave all I had because I wanted to prove myself.

So there was nevertheless a bit of a prejudice, that a woman wouldn’t be able to do that as well as a man. So...  |*| 10 | R: It was women who ran things, only women. Maybe they were more tolerant – anyway they took me on. Maybe a man might not have been taken on, I don’t know. (...) It turned out well.

It wasn’t just that both my parents worked, it was*| *|  My mother was the family’s main breadwinner, which was still quite rare in those days, more than 30 years ago. (...) And it was something that never surprised me or affected me. I think my parents were in a way more open to male/female differences than anyone who had a classic way of life, where the man brought home the money and the woman waited for her husband to get home from work. And I should say that it was quite often the contrary, that is me and my dad waiting for mum to come back home from work. The housework and the chores have always been something that I experienced as naturally being shared. (...) And I should also say that the strangest periods I had were without my dad, who went to work for a while in Paris. He was away during the week, and I found myself left alone with my mother. I found this very strange because in the end my father looked after me just as much as, if not more than, my mother. (...) I think that greatly increased my capacity to grasp the reality of both sexes. (...) I don’t think I had any preconceptions about the sexes and identity that you could link to activities that belonged to one sex or the other. I always experienced it like that. But on the contrary what I know for a fact is that my father often used to get teased a bit – in a nice way, a nice way – by other men because it was his wife who earned the money, which frankly he didn’t mind a bit, but given public perceptions at that time (...) it was something which wasn’t looked on very kindly or understood very well.

The men [who] thought that never wanted to discuss the issue. It was quite simple.

So making a little jibe at the expense of my father who was doing the washing, or picking me up from school or getting my tea ready etc. was all very funny. But it stopped there.

There really was a gender impact because I think that as a man, people will less easily accuse you of being taken on by default or as a representative of a minority.

(On) the subject of discrimination in hiring – this is typical. Of course we are still discussing the famous question that women between 25 and 35 have been asked from time immemorial – whether they intend to have kids. Which, between us, is completely stupid since a woman between 25 and 35 years is obviously much more likely to have a child than (a man). (...) What's funny is that discussing the subject you get reactions that are sometimes completely ... crazy. One of the reactions that struck me the most was a young woman saying to me in the course of a discussion: but it is clear that as a young woman I have much more risk of having a child. So having a child is a risk. And for once I said to myself: I am lucky to be a guy. (...) but where she should say it is a chance to have a child, she spoke in terms of risk. And somehow the explanation is quite simple, it is indeed the ... break which she will face in her career that may prevent her from progressing as she wished. She does not know what will happen when she comes back. (...) in terms of recruitment. Well people develop questions and attitudes specific to the sex of the person they are confronted with. In their CVs, people say that they have children, they are living together, etc. It is not absolutely necessary legally, but they do anyway. (...) and then because she is a woman and she says she has children, we will ask her how she organizes childcare in the evenings. And with a man who comes for the same job and who also has children, they will not even ask the implied question: as a woman it is you who look after the kids. Which when you look at the reality remains a fact, no doubt. But it's still funny - well funny I don’t know - but it's crazy to say to yourself that if someone has children, you will ask him how his wife organises things. If you're a man, you will be left in peace on the subject. The assumption is that it does not even concern you. I think one way or the other it is worrying.

I didn’t understand why, and it turned out that there was a group of guys, students, who were pissed out of their heads and who were amusing themselves by touching the girls’ bottoms. I resented that; I resented the girls for wanting to leave because of that, because I thought there were a lot of them and there were lots of people about so all they had to do was say something, scream or insult the guys – and they would stop or the security men would come and get them. But I resented my male friends even more because all they could say was: “That’s why we don’t like going out with girls – it always leads to problems.” So we got the picture that the problem was us. (...) This is how quite a lot of boys and girls react to violence or harassment in general: we shut up, we don’t dare make a fuss, for a number of reasons. One reason is precisely that we are afraid that if we were obliged to confront those blokes physically we would have no chance, and so you say “better a wandering hand than a punch in the eye”. Then there is the reaction of boys who don’t understand the problem at all: on the one hand they play it down, and say it isn’t as bad as all that: “OK, it’s good he didn’t do anything to you”, or “OK you shouldn’t have worn a skirt”, or, exactly the point: “You always make this into a problem”, “Going out with girls is a pain in the arse” etc. And on the other hand they don’t encourage us at all to say “You have to hit them back”.

When she realized that I got married and that he was a boy who did not go to church and that he was... he was a good boy as well. But he was more open-minded than me. His parents were storekeepers. So storekeepers are normally more open minded than employees because they earn money by their own initiative. (...) So I scared him. He started to be scared of me a bit.

You have to be prepared to take the rough with the smooth, because being a woman and not having equal opportunity, it’s a much simpler life. Equal opportunity has also less delightful effects.

When you are raising your children you cannot allow yourself to fall apart. I can tell you one episode. Once when we were coming back from the Christmas holiday, the longer ones, at that time my daughter used to go to the children garden.   |*| 11 | In the train*| *|  We had a lot of belongings and sleds. I remember having sleds with which I took her and all my belongings to the central station. I was alone with her. Trains stop in the station for a short time. I could not manage to bring all my stuff and the child to the train at once. I put all belongings to the train and when I was coming back to pick her up but the train started moving. My child was left alone in the empty station. I immediately rushed to check each door from which I could jump out...I had found one doors open to the other side of the train then I jumped  out of the moving train and wrapped the pole so that I wouldn’t fall down. (*| *| ). I remember jumping out from the moving train because my child was left in the station. It was hard... Because it’s physically hard (speaks in general about being a single mother).  |*| 12 | (...) |*| 14 | R: No. When everybody grew up then everything went better. Now I have started thinking about myself. My child is an adult and now I have started thinking about my own life. I have a partner with whom I am together for seven years. We have a relationship however we don’t have any decent conditions to live together but we meet each other quite often. And my daughter perceives him differently now. When she was little I couldn’t allow myself to try, to date because you cannot bring a stranger to your house when child sees. You cannot have a relationship because you cannot be sure that it ends up successfully.  |

R: My family was not particularly satisfied (with her being so busy with work and studies), because I always left home early in the morning and had to work from morning till night. I had to ask my grandmother to look after my children, because the children at that time were still quite little: one-year-old, the other two and a half. They were too little to go to the nursery. So, my grandmother had agreed to look after the children. Once grandmother had agreed, I had the possibility of taking the suggested position. However, I had no idea that it would be so demanding.  My Saturdays, even Sundays were occupied. Nobody respected your free time. None cared about anyone. Your job had to be done properly. And I always have had such an attitude that if you do something - do it well. Even more, you devote yourself to your work and do your best. Besides that, it was an interesting job. (*| *| )  |*| 4 | However, this situation became unbearable to my grandmother. She felt ill. There was not anybody who could look after my children. And I had to give away my children to the nursery. One of the nurseries asked that if I agreed to be an employee, a teacher in the nursery, they would let my children to attend the nursery. They lacked the staff, namely a person in charge of the child's creative activities. They (nursery) had heard from the Department of Education apparently that I have a talent for this kind of job. They called and said: ‘If you come to work, we will accept your children’. As at that time there was huge competition and a long line/row of those who wanted their children to be accepted in the nursery. Some had to wait a year. So I had agreed with my employers from the Education Department (my employers at that time) that they would keep a place for me, and here I am, I went to work in the nursery school as a teacher with my two children. They were very happy because both of them were assigned in one group and they could visit me at my office any time they wanted. (*| *| .) In this way my goal was reached – my children attended the nursery school. However, I did not like to work there because I could not realize myself, there was not enough space for me there (...) Therefore, I came back to the Department of Education, but still studied psychology. I was already in the third year of studies in Siauliai University. (*| *| .) Once my lecturer told me that ‘here (in Siauliai University) you do not have anything to do, you need to study psychology at university. You have to study general psychology and you are wasting your time here’. I was sent to St Petersburg to join Gercen University, Psychology, PhD (*| *| ) |*| 5 |  And then I left (to St Petersburg to sit her admission exams). (*| *| ) |*| 6 | I left without letting my family know about this because I knew that they would not let me. It would be horror to my granny! The children had to be brought to the nursery every day 28 kilometers away from our home, there was no direct buses. My husband left home at six in the morning, returned just in the evening. What to do now? But here I do not know what had happened. This was not for my career, but I have always had a desire to learn. I am interested in everything. I like being interested in everything, everything makes me wonder. And St Petersburg was my dream. I had been dreaming about it since my early youth, in the ninth grade I wanted to join the astronaut school there. (*| *| ) And then, of course, without telling anyone I stayed in St Petersburg to take my entrance exams. (*| *| ) |*| 7 | When I returned home after ten days (the respondent spent 10 days in St Petersburg without telling anybody). I returned home and told everyone that from now on I study not at Siauliai University, but in St Petersburg. My husband immediately wanted a divorce (they did not divorce at the end). He was terribly angry because I did not discuss this with him. This was the main reason he was angry.  My mother - she was also very furious about that because she was against the Russians. Father – he was exiled to Siberia once, and did not approve my choice (*| *| ). Just my grandmother said, \""Child, if you need to study, go, we will bring up the children. It's not every day but only several times a year during the exam sessions’. Well, this is thanks to my grandmother that I continued studying and had graduated with cum laude. I loved my studies: Art, culture, theater, art and art history! |*| 8 |  |*| 9 |  |*| 10 |  |*| 11 |  |*| 12 |  |*| 13 |  |*| 14 |  |*| 15 |  |*| 16 |  |*| 17 |  |*| 18 |  |"

Boys had always been in my company, not girls. I had shared one school desk with a boy for a long time. My first love, in the third grade*| *|  I was in love with my school desk friend. In short, I was more like a boy because boys were freer and less constrained. And yet nobody [the respondent by saying nobody means girls and women] in the village had worn trousers, but I was already wearing it because I had to play football. I have had glasses from the fifth grade and they hindered my playing, so, I always used to put them aside when I was playing. In short, honestly, femininity could have not been found in me. Maybe because of that, I am not sure; I used to dream about the motherhood in my childhood. But even in my childhood, there was no smell of maternity whatsoever. And just later on, I started to realize the qualities of a woman in me and the motherhood. When my beloved, my future husband, in one letter wrote (he used to write me letters when he was serving in the army): ‘Do you want to have my children?’ So, then I wrote him back that I had not dreamed about the children, but I thought that our children would be very beautiful. Then somehow I have started to realize that I would have to become a mother.  |*| 3 | R: Before our marriage, my and my future husband’s relationship had lasted for eight years. We had not had the love relationship [sexual relations/intercourse]. Also, my future husband, in the very beginning of our relationship, challenged me. I remember we even did not kiss, even then when I was eighteen years old. We used to sit on the stairs in front of my family house (I did not let him in my house) and he leaned towards me and asked (he lived eighteen kilometers away from me, so, he used to come over with his bike when I was back from my studies in the capital city). And he asked: \""Do you know what is the greatest value for a girl?\"" I started to think: being a good housewife, being neat, not to mention being beautiful, of course. However, I had not succeeded in guessing the right answer. And then he embraced me so strongly and cuddled and said – ‘virginity’. This was for me... First of all, I felt shame that I could not say this first, secondly, that this man thinks this way. Up until now this [virginity] is the greatest value for me and I keep telling this to my children. My grandson is in a relationship now, has a girlfriend. And I always say him: ‘You know how it was when your grandfather said this to me?’ Of course, other times - other children.  (...) R: First of all, you know, femininity and the fact that the biggest gift of being born a woman is that I can be a mother. I possess that from a young age, I dreamed about the kids. And when I was little*| *| In the countryside, during the post-war years... I was born in the post-war years, in 1947. I did not have any dolls*| *|  I lived far away in the country side where the house had a dirty floor. There was no electricity, as in most places in the village at that time. I used to make my dolls from straws and rags – they were my children. And when we let the cows graze in the fields in the summer, there were these plants, linen. And this linen*| *| *|  But He was distant to me, I had a formal faith. But if I had had faith, if He had allowed me to get pregnant, he would have allowed giving birth to the babies. It was my biggest weakness of my entire life and the biggest grievance, I do not have any other regrets*| *| Just that that I have not given a birth to other two children. And now my daughter is continuing my desire. She has three [children] now, but she plans on having five. But it is also the issue of age, she is forty-two. She has started to give birth when she was over thirty already. She got married when she was thirty. She thinks that the greatest happiness is to be a mother. I watched as she brings up her children. She has inherited my maternal feelings. My femininity is like the embodiment of motherhood.  |*| *| We got married after eight years of our relationship. All the time we were faithful to each other. He also wanted to have children and he loved our children very much. However, the difficult life circumstances have occurred. We had a strong relationship, big love to each other... Respect*| *| Later, he felt sick - the disease of alcohol, alcoholism. Because his family had roots in the alcoholism and, although he did not drink at a young age, he began to progress, because he worked for the Russian team at the factory and used to drink every day at work. And it [alcoholism], without even noticing, sucked him in, absorbed him... Due to this, the rest of our life was very difficult, but it ...  |*| 5 |  (...) |*| 6 |  R: ... He always respected me very much. And we were in an agreement that if he came back drunk, then he did not make any claims to me as a woman [no sexual intercourse]. He always kept this respect, even during the most difficult times. Later on he passed away, he had a stroke, he had a very high blood pressure, and he died young, 45-years-old. I raised the children mostly on my own, as he used to work from six in the morning till twelve in the evening, and he used to come back very late. He used to leave early in the morning and returned late at night and he was able to be with the children only in the weekends, but when the children were little, they attended the Sunday nursery school, because I was studying in Leningrad, St. Petersburg, the Institute of Culture at that time.  |"

They appointed me and then I thought OK I would work here, I would try. Then I started working. I liked the job. In addition to that, I found a wife in 1962, who just had graduated from an academy.

I have never spanked my children, but I think that this is like that (a man has to spank children, not a woman). This comes from our ancestors, it was like that for thousands of years and probably something in the genes comes from this side. Nowadays we all hope that women would have equal opportunities, I think this would be very nice that there would be equality, but everyone is ... However, I would not like to see that a woman, in case of a disaster or conflict would take a gun in her hands and go to defend ...

Then I lived near the (name of a sport centre) my windows are in front of it and one summer day I saw boys, they were older than me, for sure, dressing these kimono, these coloured belts, dressing like judoka, who were practising some tecniques, I can't remember exactly but I remember them having fun in this very cosy and nice context that looked like a party and I asked my parents what they were doing, I became very curious, they answered me and they brought me there asking if I wanted to try and a real love for judo began, it lasted at least 11 years, then I had to quit for reasons,,, well I had to choose, either I had to choose school or sport as I came to very high level in competitions... |*| 3 | (...)  |*| 4 | R: There is the fact is that judo is a male dominated sport, and when I started there were not many girls, they were almost all boys and the thing that always struck me was that whenever I told anybody that I was practising judo, the first thing people thought of was “Oh my God, you’re a tomboy!” or, \""what a masculine sport you’re in”, it was a sort of ‘universal judgement’ and nobody would have told you “Judo? Really? What a beautiful sport!”. I was rather told “Shall I be scared of you?”. So you didn’t know if you would have been happy of those opinions or not, as you don’t know if those statements shall be deemed as criticism or praise, the fact that you are unassailable, as you can defend yourself from anything, from any potential approach; for sure you are a judo-girl  and you feel a bit excluded, as girls from 5 to 11 years old tend to enrol in dance courses or volley or other feminine sports, what else? Tennis too. Martial arts were known only as masculine sports at that time, so for me it was a bit peculiar to find myself in certain situations, like for example at the beginning of the year my physical education teacher at the beginning of the year asked us 'which sports are you practising?', all girls were answering the same sport and I came out and said 'judo!' and the teacher herself was surprised of it. |*| 5 | Then with time things have changed as judo gained a lot of appeal and we were a lot of people at the sport centre, a lot of girls, and I found  a very beautiful context. I always had a strong personality and was not disappointed about comments but a different girl could have reacted in a another way, being hurt or feeling stigmatised*| *|   |*| 7 | R: No, it isn't. At primary school there is not that feeling of being set aside, more or less you are friend of anybody else, but boys for sure they treat you more like one of them, this is very peculiar 'ehi, are you making judo? then you are a tomboy!', but even my grandmother was telling me: 'why don't you do a different sport?', grandmothers they are always worried about you, they were scard I could hurt myself, while it is a very calm sport, really a soft one, if you do it the right way you're not going to hurt yourself in any way, but even grandmas they had to get worried ' you'r really our familiy's tomboy!', but in my opinion this is not true at all, as judo like all martial arts it's a sport that can be practised by men and women without the need of having this distinction and of course it's not that men are more talented, in my experience and in my opinion I had many girlfriends who practised judo and we were all good the same way and then you measure yourself, as you have fights, with techniques, of course, it is very nice to confront, men with women, as you cannot give it for granted that men will necessarily or have to do it... |*| 8 | (...) |*| 10 | R: Well, I never thought about it, as they never influenced us, they never told me 'go to and do judo as you need to defend yourself! |*| 11 | (...) |*| 12 | R: This never came to my ming as judo... you have to live not as continuos fight, or as aggressiveness, there are many prejudices about these sports, in my opinion, all the trainings, the context, it was a lot of fun ... |*| 14 | R: I never thought of it...   |"

If I would have done it at 16, I think my parents would have not allowed me to do it with my own girlfriends; if on one side I can maybe say “you did not behave like that with me”, I can understand that parents may be more worried about their daughter, as women risk to a wider extent than boys in the world outside. |*| 4 |  For sure there would be many things to say about consenting to go out, to go to party, I never went out before I was 15/16 years old, I did not do it as my own friends they were not allowed to go out at night themselves while now teenagers start to do it when they are at the junior high school, I don't know, maybe times have changed... |*| 5 | I : How old is your brother?   |*| 7 | I : But you feel to be part of a different generation than your brother?  |*| 8 | R :Yes, this is for sure, and this is something I verified also with other people of the same age as I am, they are allowed to do many more things, and they have many more things, as far as my brother is concerned and for sure also because he is a boy, they are much more permissive and soft, is not that they are giving him whatever he is asking for? but another example is about computer; I didn't use it until a certain age, not because they didn't want me, I wasn't that interested in, and then the social networks' fashion boosted, these arrived more or less when I was 16, while my brother he grew up with them, these things already existed when he was 12/13, he was not connected everyday and he easn't a maniac of these websites but for sure he met the computers' world, videogames and technologies long before me.    |*| 9 | (*| *| )  |*| 10 | R: (...) Then there is something else, domestic work, for example  |*| 12 | R: It’s not that my brother is exempted from it, but if I don’t make it, mainly my mother in this case, as my father is not going to tell me “do the washing up, do this or that” but she needs help and for sure she is not going to ask my brother for washing up, to hang up the washing or to make beds, so my brother is always leaving the bed unstripped, while I was raised with the expectation that I should have stripped it down, and he never makes it.   |*| 13 |    |*| 15 | R : That's for sure, my father is very messy, he needs his mess even in his work, but for sure women are the ones who work more at home.  |*| 16 | I often was  envying my brother as each time I wondered  “why do I always have to do anything and he doesn’t?”. If I don’t tidy up my room my mother is calling me all sort of names as she loves order and tidiness and me and my brother we also share the same room, and if his part of the room is more than usual he can always say “yes, I am going to clean up later on” and she is going to do it for him as she knows how he is lazy and she knows he is never going to do it, he says he’s going to do it but he won’t, while I am the one who tends to help her more.

But in my childhood I lived with the idea of becoming a football player for a while, but the way my parents educated me, it was much more oriented to study than sport, so I started to study music since when I was a child, as I can play the piano, so I was fond of that, but then when you grow up and you have physical education and you go out with friends, you cannot go and not being able to play soccer, at least a bit, or playing basket, so I always found myself in a sort of middle way, I can play but I am not that good player, I have been forced to learn sports to be able to establish relationships, as you cannot be one  of those who always carry a book with them, also to avoid the opposite labelling of being a swot.

In spite of this I never took part to a fist fight or a brawl or anything similar, and I don't know how but I could always step out from situations where something like that could have happened, or maybe I was lucky, but I never experienced that  traditional side of masculity, being a bit violent.    |

Some friends of mine they asked me to join but I really didn’t want but at that time you could not avoid to do it, otherwise you would have been considered as the one who is out of the flock and maybe they could have thought of other things too, so*| *| . |*| 4 | R : It was completely strange if a boy at that age didn’t had in mind all the time not to stay with a girl if he simply did not have this desire in that moment so if you refused to go you were considered to be strange and peculiar, very much*| *| . |*| 5 | I : Very gay?  |*| 6 | R : Well, at that time I am not sure mentality was focused only on that, in general it was so, but not really for sure, as saying either “gay” or simply “boys who do not stay together with their peers” would be limiting, so it was implicitly thought of but it wasn’t only that, it was more a sensation of not being part of the flock, not only because you do not go with girls but because you do not act with the herd, so if you were going to refuse for several times you came to be isolated from the group; with the wisdom of hindsight not being part of a group would not have caused me a lot of problems, but in that period if you were not in a group, if you didn’t play soccer, if you didn’t have friends you were going to be seriously limited; at that time as I was quite handsome and I was quit nice, we were only two to be successful with girls, but many times to be honest I really did not felt like doing it, not because of going with girls or not, but because of the whole formal role playing around it which was not really amusing, the roles were fixed and it was a bit boring, as the feeling was*| *|  5, 10 minutes of the usual sentences to get their goals*| *|    |*| 8 | R: My friends' ones. As at that moment I was not interested in it and maybe already had a girlfriend. All this is to say that when they were calling me, it's not that I got traumatized for it, but the fact of being part of the herd and being, together with another friend of mine, one of the most succesful with girls, gave us this role, that maybe my friend liked but I did not, so I often went out but I was suffering for it, for having to play this role, and as soon as possible I ran away, when I realized that the group was succeeding, they were all happy and I ran away.  |*| 9 | (...) |*| 10 | R: I am honest, without being presumptuous I also met interesting girls in this way, as the ones who came here they also had their own norms, and I insist in saying that we were not the ones who chose, but they were choosing us and they had, I think, the myth of the italian   lover, french girls were much more emancipated, as they were seen as more emancipated, and actually they were if compared to us, so they were the ones who chose and according to precise criterial, beyond the masks...  |

For example he was allowed to attend an English school for 5 years, which was quite expensive, while nobody was thinking of investing money on me. Moreover, they bought a lot of books to my brother and not to me, and they ended up with telling me that I didn't like to read. The truth was that nobody was reading any books to me, we had a very different treatment; he was good at school while I was a dunce, but probably this happened as I was quite left to myself and I had to take care of myself alone and that was why he was smarter and more committed to studying. |*| 4 | While me, I had problems at school so at that point it was clear that... 'she (interviewee's name) will continue working in her parents' shop and her brother...we will see', so he began studying  foreign languages etc. while I chose to attend a School of Arts and I was preparing myself to become a Teacher of Arts. |*| 5 | With time I became aware of this form of discrimination which originates in the way my own  parents have been brought up: my mother was the only girl in a family of all males, and her mother died at 50 leaving a very large family with many children and an immigrated husband in a very poor social context so that my own mother ended up by replacing her mother and she had to renounce to herself, and to remove any personal ambitions to take care of her family. |*| 7 | R: Yes, replacing her mother with her brothers, and taking care of them, then when they grew up and could take care of themselves she started to work very early and so she didn't or she could not have any ambitions, I don't think she wanted to study she was living in the countryside, she had a very simple life all dedicated to work and she probably imagined to form her own family and nothing more; she didn't have any perspectives for her own children, neither any redemption/emancipation ambition fort her own children. Luckily my brother seemed to be much more determined than me and clear ideas, but even if was difficult I managed to redeem myself too: at a certain point I decided to try to attend the university, even if felt I was not up to it, and I had to work to pay it, so I started this adventure, to study and work at the same time, and to show that I was able to do both things.  |*| 8 | I was not even recognized for my positive results and the efforts I made. I really believe that my parents' upbringing, particularly on my mother's side, didn't lead to improve their children's condition but it seem like it repeated the same dynamics, in spite of the different economic conditions and the place we were living was different as my family moved to  (name of the town)  so I was born in a city, but in spite of this, it didn't change so much their minds.   |*| 11 | R: Well, no, probably more than listening to his wishing it was that he was more good at school, he had better results, when my mother went to talk to my brother's professor they gave her positive feedbacks, while those about me were tremendous.   |*| 13 | R: Yes I was, so for me it was difficult to perceive myself as a competent and talented person, then at a certain time, probably at those age when you revolt, I had to rebel, I wanted to do it, as I wanted to do and test myself, I was already working in my parents' shop, so I already knew how my life would have looked like and I didn't want it, I wanted to try a different life; so it was all about going against the tide, against my mother's will, my father was staying a bit to the margins, but my mother was very confrontational, so I had to struggle, and to show her... so it was really hard.  |*| 14 | If I think of it now, I really find it very cruel, the fact that a woman who lived in her conditions, a very resigned one as for what happened to her, her destiny, didn't want to redeem her own daughter. I have in mind scenes from some films where mothers invest their daughters with expectations that are resulting from frustrations and their own failures, things they could not do while in my situation... nothing to the mother and nothing to her daughter, but luckily my personality allowed me to rebel and to gor through with my choice. |

As she herself had lived a tempered life she was not able to be generous with me, to make a gesture that could have emancipated me, saying 'I had a very hard life, a sad one, and now I would like that my daughter could be free and happier, less troubled than I was'. She contented with what she had, she didn't make anything more than what she was expected to; frankly speaking I didn't find it fair to be castrated myself, when living in a completely different context; this was while I reacted and revolted; this conflict that arose with her was due to her lack of intelligence a scarce attitude to understanding. And this discrimination did not hit my brother as my parents used to say 'he is a boy while you are a girl', and he was allowed to go out and had more money to spend. At the end they confessed that they gave him much more money than me, not because of his being a man, this was not explicitly said. I think my mother had a gender problem.   |*| 6 | R: She was maybe afraid that I could do things that she never did herself, like exchanging endearments, but it wasn't the situation, or she was thinking we did who knows what... also at an intimate level... perhaps being 14 years old we could even fell free, I had many friends who had girl/boyfriends, it didn't seem strange to me.   |*| 7 | R: I was quite responsible, I was aware I was not in any dangers, I was there in spirit, I always thought she was very frustrated, and I told her, as she had a hard life she wanted the same for me, it was very easy, no big thoughts, or reasons, or explanations, it was like that, stop.  |*| 9 | R: Yes I was, in some way, even if I faced it and got over it, I consulted a psychologist too for this reason, but yes, these were things that influenced me or certain dynamics, this made me an aggressive person, ready to defend her space by fighting tooth and nail, as I had to gain it by way of suffering; yes it influenced me, I have to say, of course with my son I have a very open behaviour, I want him to be free to decide what he will want, I think I am more reasonable than my mother is. My mother, I don't think she is a very intelligent person, so she is not able to understand, while I think I have a flexible mind, I am able to understand the complexity of things and consequently to mediate, but I have a sort of monster in me, that I have to stab, and even at present, some comments she makes, oldstyle ones, when I get them*| *|  |*| 11 | R: Yes, they always manage to trigger certain aggressive mechanisms, as this is an attitude I had to kill and suppress, as it was either not reasonable or objective but it was only the result of a constraining and selfconstraining upbringing, as my mother is concerned, who made her not very flexible and open minded, not able to identify herself. I think this was something she never did. |

This was the enormous difference between a boy and a girl, and it was really tough, as I am someone who never accepted this subordination of women, neither when I was a teenager or as an adult; when I was 18 I married but I never accepted to be subjected as I thing people have to be treated in an equal way, women and men, you need to respect them as persons. |*| 8 | As I had my parents' example, in spite of living in such a small village at those times, they were always respecting each other, both of them they were working to support their family and to do things together, I never saw them arguing, or my father telling my mother ' you have to do this and that', never, and it was something I always admired, they were really united for carrying on their family. And that's it. |*| 10 | R: No, absolutely, my father was a very intelligent person, very talented in many things he did. He was one of the first to buy a car in that village, one of the first who bought a tractor and had quite a big cowshed and hired farmers, he tried many things, went to war and then he migrated to (name of a foreign country) to find his way in life, he stayed there for a while and then he said it wasn't soemthing for him and he preferred to be close to his family and do something in his own country, well he actually managed to do something there too, but ... anyway any of them was leading, in any decisions they had to take they talked and they always decided together, and this was really something I liked in my family. |*| 12 | R: Yes, for sure it was the context where they lived and I have to tell you that when I married the first thing he told me when he came to (name of the city) and visited me, as I made a radical change, from such a small village, and the first thing he told me was 'whatever problem you may have, both economically and with your husband, you have to be aware that you're backed by your own family' without meaning that they wanted to intervene in our relationship but to let me know that in case of troubles I had a family to rely on. |

I was very stimulated and at the beginning it was a bit difficult, we rented a flat but it was not furnished and there was everything to be done, so the impact was a bit hard at the beginning. But then we slowly managed to get away with it quite well and I saw the difference between my small village and the city and I started thinking of going to work, as I wanted to do it and I could do it; as my husband was member of a cooperative and I told him I wanted to go to work too and he asked the manager if they could hire me as a secretary and and I work there for a while. Then my husband had a bout of jealousy as one of the cooperative’s members was coming back at the office from work and asked me if I would have liked anything to drink as I was having lunch; he was kind and when my husband came back and realized that this man offered a bottle of water  when we were back at home he told me \""no, you’re not going to come back to that place anymore, there are all males”; this jealousy came out, a sort of chauvinism, and it was something I did to make him happy as I saw he was really*| *| . It was really a bad thing this event, I perceived it as a lack of trust, then I saw he  was really bothered and I decided not to go there anymore but immediately  afterwards I regretted it and I still regret having accepted this compromise, as I would have found myself in a different positions, I would have become a clerk and with my skills I would have  gone a longer way than I did. In any case the ambition to work and to be independent was still in me as I am not the one who  likes to ask “I need for this, please give me this and that”, even if he came home and gave me the money without asking “what did you do with the money?”. But it was something as a part of me, that I could not accept, right? Then I was engaged in other jobs, and I started working with him when he started up his independent business, and I was working in a confectionery for many years against his will as he didn’t agree but I stood out as I was still angry for that time when I renounced, I wanted to go to work even if I had children, to prove my capacities. |*| 5 | (...) |*| 9 | R: No it was much more closer to me, it wasn't ambiguos the fact of going to (name of the city) was my salvation, as I wouldn't have lived in such a small village, I didn't like it. |*| 11 | R: They were much more appreciated both at work and even those who were housewives they said 'at home women are working anyway' while in my village there was this clich*| è*| , the woman who wakes up in the morning, cleans her 5 metres home and then sits outside to door and starts gossiping the whole day long, they were not all the same, for sure, but most of them as their husbands were farm workers and they were housewives,  so I was thinking 'if I shall live this way I would go crazy, I cannot accept it', it was not in my mind, and I had it very clear, then when I arrived to (name of the city) I began living, I said: 'ooh, finally we arrived to a place where there is life, there's movement here!', I like life when you have something to do, otherwise I feel bad, so when I arrived I said 'this is the right place for me, and I do not regret anything, any doubts. |"

Not only me... but there were several of us working on the same topic. And what I noticed was that my professor who was a man, paid much more attention to what we were saying than to what our male colleague from the group was saying, and from us he was asking questions as well while from the boy, his presentation was over in about two minutes, and that was it. And you can’t even say that this was because he was the last in the row, and that we had to hurry because we had no more time left, no, he was in the middle, and in fact had still things to say but the professor interrupted him, while he listened to me and another girl who was presenting, that is, we were allowed to carry on until the end of our presentations, and he was even asking questions from us. And with this professor it happened more than once that (sighs) that just because a young lady was perhaps better dressed (smiles ironically) or I was dressed up for an exam, or just in class, so he differentiated us from the others. |*| 4 | R: Yes, in a positive way, he privileged us. And for example that’s why (laughs) I had better results for my final exam than a boy from the same group, attending the same class. (*| *| ) |*| 5 | (*| *| ) |*| 7 | R: Well... it was definitely embarrassing. Because I usually feel embarrassed anyway when I have to stand in front of other people and say something, then I am already embarrassed but if all attention is directed straight at me and in such a way... if there is this kind of attention, then I am definitely embarrassed or become embarrassed. And... it was a little bit annoying too to see that this guy from our group, he had worked just as hard as we had, I could tell because we had to sit together before and I knew that he had worked very hard, and he is really that hard-working and honest type... a meticulous student, so it really bothered me, it was annoying why he was not... when he had*| *|  maybe he had a much better presentation than us... and it annoyed me why he was not allowed to finish his presentation. |*| 9 | R: Yes, totally unfair. |*| 10 | (*| *| ) |*| 12 | R: (laughs) Yes, I think there was this strategic aspect too, related to this subject. This was a final exam and only a one-semester subject, so... And during that term, this was the first semester at university, we did not take this subject too seriously, and also the professor’s style implied that*| *|  he basically implied that the most important was to be present at the lectures, and at the exam too it seemed it was enough just to show up and I thought, well, if that was the case, let’s make the most of it... and let me receive not just a C but a B or B+. If I can get that just like this, why not make use of it. So yes, there was a strategic reason behind this, very much so. |*| 14 | R: Yes, it did (laughs). Although, this was also quite...how to say...maybe unfair with people from other groups, and also with the boys in my group, because, while another group that took the exam with a female professor suffered a lot because they had to work out specific questions during the exam, for us, our only task was to look good.  |*| 16 | R: It was quite funny in fact, to see that even the professor was getting embarrassed by his own personality really or his own behaviour or I don’t know how to describe this best, when he saw that all the girls were really... I mean everyone was really dressed up; there was no one in shabby or just casual clothes... |*| 17 | (*| *| ) |*| 19 | R: No, not really. No, I didn’t, because this was not directed only at me, it was not only with me*| *| but towards all the girls*| *| so I think, if that had been the case, if it had become too personal, then maybe. But otherwise, the way it was, no. It was not more negative than this.  |*| *| he was grading you based on the exam, right? How did he relate to the male group members? Was it obvious that girls were privileged? |*| 21 | R: Yes, boys received much more difficult questions. He did not fail anyone in the end but he gave more difficult questions to boys, while from girls he maybe*| *| it happened that he  did not even ask anything, but sort of OK, fine, you passed, next one, please. But boys, he questioned them more*| *|  So, from them*| *|  as if he had higher expectations from them, as if they had to know these things. So as if to show, that yes, “I have taught you something this semester.” |*| 22 | (*| *| ) |*| 24 | R: No, no, not, he is in fact quite an easy-going person. I mean*| *| he jokes a lot, and no one takes him seriously, even if he were to make such passes*| *|  so no*| *|  but he is not taken seriously, nor are his jokes, so no, I don’t think that*| *|  even if he made passes at girls they wouldn’t take him seriously*| *|  in fact there is no room or there is no time for him to formulate such things towards anyone because his subject is not one of the main subjects and neither the girls nor the professor takes it seriously , so I don’t think that there was anything like that*| *|  |*| *| I don’t know if this happens that you girls speak about him among yourselves, I guess you do, if the advice gets around that it is good to dress up*| *| so, I mean, how do you speak about him among each other? |*| 26 | R: Like a complete idiot. But really (laughs). In fact*| *| we talked about him, like at the beginning of the year let’s say, that he is a complete idiot, you don’t have to take him seriously but it is good to keep in mind this or that. But there was no serious talking concerning this or him, really. |*| 28 | R: No*| *| Even this idiot thing was more in a joking manner. (laughs). He is not such a negative guy. |*| 30 | R: Well*| *| *| ) |

There were no young ones among them, of my age, like in their 20s or 30s, no... And in fact they were all minority citizens and*| *|  it was with them*| *|  not once that in fact that I was going home from high school and they were there after work, waiting for my father to see if he was to give them any more work to do. They were sitting outside our house in the grass, and I was coming home by bike, and it was summer time, or at least the weather was good, and I was wearing shorts. And not once it happened that they whistled at me or*| *|  or for example, I heard from my father that they had asked him how many goats he would exchange me for (laughs). So there were such incidents. And really this was not only embarrassing but also frightening. You need to imagine that these were quite big men with a menacing face, and being only 16 or 17 it was not so pleasant to hear such comments, even if they expressed*| *|  appreciation for my looks*| *|  or they meant no harm at all. It is not good to hear such things from anyone, but even worse from a group of 20 men and me being alone because my father for example had not yet come out of the house. That’s frightening. And the point is*| *|  that although my brother was right there behind me, he got no such comments, as there were no women among them, and women don’t do such things anyway*| *| although more and more so nowadays but*| *|  (laughs). So my brother was not picked out this way, just me, maybe because my legs were uncovered below my knees or god knows why, maybe that day I had a nicer make-up or hairdo or I don’t know*| *| So this was quite bad that they whistled after me, and in fact not after me, as I was not just passing by but standing there just one step away from them, and I got comments like “you are so beautiful” and “are you your father’s daughter?” and such things. So this was quite*| *| even if just to make fun*| *| from a male stranger*| *| or several of them, it was not pleasant. |*| 3 | (*| *| ) |*| 4 | R: (*| *| ) But then I learned how to deal with such things. My father also told me that they were not going to do anything, and they only had a big mouth, and that he was also always around, so even if anything was to happen other than just talk, he would be there to deal with the men. But nothing like that happened so I learned how to handle these things, and even up to now. I live in a small town, right, and if there is a construction site, I don’t know if you have been in such a situation, but what happens is that if a beautiful girl passes by, workers whistle at her or they say “you are so beautiful” or something of this sort. And I learnt how to handle this, such as with a smile, or I shout back something like: “look at me now because you won’t have another chance” or something like that*| *| So I try to take it less seriously and I don’t care. But when you are so young*| *| like 14 or younger*| *| when you start growing to be feminine*| *| to experience such things then*| *| it is quite frightening, really. And then to discuss this with your parents, that this and this has happened*| *| and then they give you advice and their experiences and then you learn how to handle such things. (*| *| ) |*| 5 | (*| *| ) |*| 7 | R: My father, for example, told me that he knew them well, because each year they were more or less the same group that he got, so... What’s funny in this is that my father always gets the most troublesome, because*| *| he is good at disciplining people, so he always gets such beasts*| *| beasts? (laughs), and he told me not to be afraid of them because they were afraid of him. And they would not dare to do anything like that. So*| *| yes,*| *| that’s all.  |

Luckily, it had never happened that someone would have followed me*| *|  so*| *|  in fact*| *|  I think people can see it on me that if there was an incident like that I could protect myself (laughs). So*| *|  nothing like that happened so far. And*| *| I could also say that this is part of everyday life. I mean, wherever I go*| *|  err*| *|  let that be a swimming pool or a disco*| *|  I always run into such people who cannot behave themselves, or perhaps this is how they try to express their liking, or I don’t know. And they choose this style and*| *|  well*| *|  I had to learn to deal with this, so that I do not spend the night sobbing at home over such incidents*| *| or (laughs) that I cannot handle it and I get rid of this stress this way but*| *| otherwise*| *|  I have talked to other girls*| *| .and they all said that*| *| ”oh, but this is part of life, that’s how it is.” |*| 4 | R: Yes*| *|  in fact*| *|  not that these happen so often but rather that they come unexpectedly, so for example, if we sit in a pub, all girls, for a girls’ night and we sit down to talk, at any moment a man might appear, who might be slightly tipsy and start talking to you that way*| *|  and such unexpected situations were those rather where you had to learn that whenever such a man turns up, you should not panic and run away crying or become hysteric, like “how dares he talk like that?” but rather*| *|  because this does not make much sense, I think, if we take this to heart, because in fact you cannot avoid such situations. |*| 6 | R: It does make me angry, on the one hand. It makes me angry because yes, I am a woman and I can take some nice compliments but not if they talk to me rudely. On the other hand, this is also flattering in some way. That somebody notices that I am a woman. Even if it is not expressed appropriately. Of course, this also depends on what has been said*| *| (laughs)*| *|  for example, if it is something very rude, I feel like going up to him and slapping him on the face but if it is of the “that’s still all right” category than I say, “OK”*| *|  (laughs). |*| 8 | R: Not necessarily on who says it, it rather depends on the how. So if a not-such-a-good-looking but sweet guy says it, I say “oh, you are so cute” but if it’s a very good-looking guy but what he says is very rude, then I would just as much slap him too*| *|  so*| *|  (laughs). It’s all the same. |*| 10 | R: Yes. |*| 12 | R: No, and we are still friends. But*| *| well, he was quite drunk then*| *|  |*| 14 | R: Yes, that’s why I gave myself permission to slap him, because I knew that he would approach me the following day and apologize, and say “I am sorry, just you know, this or that was the situation” |*| 16 | R: Well, I am the queen of self-defence in general (laughs).  |*| 18 | R: Well, mostly verbally*| *|  so for example my communication skills are rather developed from this perspective. I was raised this way, like “my child, if I am not around, defend yourself”*| *|  (laughs) and now that I live in (name city) but already at high school too*| *|  so you cannot always expect others to be around to support you and*| *|  otherwise, I make very good use of this in the (name city) night scene too*| *|  and I don’t just protect myself but also my female friends perhaps. I don’t know why but I usually surround myself by people who are much smaller than me and much more vulnerable and it has already happened not once that, “please, (name interviewee), help me,” or something of this sort*| *|  |*| 19 | (*| *| ) |*| 21 | R: Well, in fact that’s when I became conscious of the fact that women just by looking good can achieve quite a lot with men, in fact. Or to put it this way, they can get quite a lot from men just because of this. And so that’s when it dawned on me that women have quite a variety of means to exercise power over men, so to say, but on the other hand, this is quite*| *| well*| *| . annoy*| *| not that it annoyed me, but made me angry actually, this idea, that men largely perceive women as an aesthetic object in their lives, I mean, I have heard from my female friends several times that*| *| *|  I never perceive myself this way, nor women in general, but many men still do or*| *|  yes, they still do. And this is extremely annoying and I am very angry with such people. |*| 22 | (*| *| ) |*| 24 | R: Yes*| *|  it has taught me to fight, so to say*| *|  these might seem big words now, or I don’t know but*| *|  it has taught me to fight, I mean, it has given me strength and perseverance, that I will show no matter what, that just because he is a man, it does not necessarily mean that he is better at things, and that because he is a man it does not necessarily mean that he is cleverer, it does not mean that he is funnier, it’s not sure that he can find his way better, and yes, I like to prove, if I am in the company of men, that I might not only have a pretty face but am also clever and funny, and so*| *|  in such things, it is in this way that it has changed me. |*| 26 | R: Well, in fact I live among men. I have two younger brothers and of course, there is my father*| *|  and with my two younger brothers*| *|  you can really notice these kinds of changes. My elder younger brother too, for example, said more than once, he has just started dating (laughs), and he told me that*| *|  he has told me several times that “it is because you are with us, that I value women much more than before” because*| *|  he is not really the type who thinks that women’s place is in the kitchen and women ought to cook and clean; he has started to think differently about these things and thinks that*| *|  although it has taken quite some time to achieve this with my brothers (laughs)*| *|  thinks that women too have rights, and are not there only to cook, wash and clean and he really thinks now that “OK, women are not just for cooking, washing and cleaning.” But with my father you can still see, that well*| *|  he likes his stomach much more than to let women buy some cold snacks for supper*| *|  he*| *|  insists on getting a hot dinner, and a clean flat, but he would not do the washing up*| *|  so*| *| .younger ones are easier to*| *|  and also, society, I think has become much more open concerning these issues, and well, this is not just my influence on my younger brothers but all what they can see around themselves matter a lot too. |

So given that I was born a boy, this was an advantage for me. Or*| *|  I could also put it in this way: I escaped from something*| *|  for example perhaps the negative experience that my father is not happy to have a fourth daughter. Err*| *|  This manifested how for example in*| *|  but this would rather be my sister’s story, or it hurts her more, because I was not conscious of this at the time, but for example, my father when he went to plough, then he took me with him*| *|  when I was old enough for that. There are three years difference between my sister and me. So when I was old enough, then it happened that he took me to plough as against my sister, or to do any such work, or to weld, while perhaps my sisters also wished to join him. Perhaps this is their story. But I experienced the positive side of this, that is, that my father and I are doing something together. Err*| *|  And these are sort of boyish or male things. Had I been born a girl, then perhaps I would have experienced it even more than my sisters that*| *|  err*| *|  I do not live up to this unspoken, unacknowledged expectation*| *|  to be a male. (small laugh) Err*| *|  It showed in little stories like spending time with my father, doing boyish things together. And*| *|  (pause) |*| 4 | R: This is more of the result of my sister’s personal development, she recognised this*| *|  that*| *|  or she recognised such stories in her life, which she experienced as negative, something she missed, which she has got over with since then and has been healing from these wounds, if they are wounds indeed. And obviously they are, yes. I would have never noticed if she had not warn*| *|  if she had not called my attention at this. |*| *|  did she talk it over with you? |*| 6 | R: There are three years between us... she was at university at the time, so perhaps she was 22-23 years old and I was around 18-19. |*| *|  |*| 8 | R: There have been*| *|  many*| *|  so this was obviously a process for her, so it was a series of conversations. Shorter or longer conversations with our parents as well. Spontaneously. And also with me when we were talking about our past. In the car, while we were driving, we spontaneously had these talks and we didn’t need to sit down just for this. Err*| *|  Yes. So it was a process. And obviously I tried to process it too in retrospect, which was not as difficult for me as for her. So this is the story. |*| 9 | (*| *| ) |*| *| *|  So we had a very good family and this was not such a deep wound to her I think. But for sure I basically think that*| *|  So I have never said and never will, when this is a topic to discuss with my wife, that I want her to bear me a son, and I will never say any such kind of thing. I think I will have the ability to love my daughters as much as my sons. |*| 12 | (*| *| ) |*| 13 | R: I can imagine it about myself that*| *|  having four daughters, I will say that perhaps we can manage financially a fifth child, and perhaps that will be a boy. But most likely I would not make a sixth child for this reason. Just to have a son. But I also don’t want the situation that we have five daughters and we won’t have the sixth child just because I vowed to myself not to have the sixth because most likely I want that in order to have a son. |*| 15 | R: (laughs) Well. Probably not. Probably not. So maybe I have not changed much in this aspect as my father didn’t*| *|  But perhaps if we had the reverse, let’s say we have three boys or four, then I*| *|  if my wife expressed the wish, or I expressed the wish to have a daughter*| *|  this can very likely happen*| *|  |*| 16 | (*| *| ) |*| *| ) I have not asked it specifically how this might impact your own child rearing. What do you think? I mean this experience your sister shared with you. |*| 18 | R: Well. (ponders) Perhaps it’s due to this, yes, but also due to my later studies and my research on this topic that it will have an impact. Err.. so for example, we will buy little toy-trucks to our daughters if they want that, or they can play boys’ games. Or, if it's daughters that I have, or I have daughters at all, and there will be some kind of mechanical activity I am doing, then I will involve them. This was voiced by my fianc*| é*| e as well, as something she missed in her childhood, that is, that her father also took her brothers with him. So she will demand this too, if I by myself would have forgotten. But it’s logical I think to involve my daughters in what I do, be it taking a nail and hammering, and do boyish things*| *| because a woman doesn’t need to be clumsy in technical things just because she is a woman. And boys too can help their mom in cooking. Sure*| *|  and definitely in cleaning, this is obvious, I will take it for granted to help in the housework at home and there would be some sharing. |*| 19 | (*| *| ) |*| 21 | R: Yes, I had to participate. Not as much as my sisters did, I think they did a lot more housework than I did, but I also cleaned sometimes or*| *|  I was the one who put the washed clothes on the clothes line. There were these things*| *|  doing the dishes for example until we had a dishwasher. Then only putting the dirty dishes in the dishwasher. So*| *|  but my father did not participate in all this. So I didn’t take it from him, I simply did it for my mother, or I guess my father would have expected me to do this anyhow. Err*| *|  But this, for example, I would do it in a way in my home that I also help so that my sons would see that I help their mom in the housework. Although I think that it is primarily for the woman to do the housework. So I don’t think that*| *|  ok, this will sound chauvinistic*| *|  But to say that 50-50% and that this is possible*| *|  I think that life brings it this way, and I am also lucky because my fianc*| é*| e, she actually doesn’t want me to participate in the housework at all because she thinks this is a female thing and women should be let alone to do it. But I still will*| *|  |*| 23 | R: I think this has developed in this way in society and I don’t think that from one generation to the next we should declare that from now on it is 50-50%, because if we say this, we should also say that washing and fixing the car is also 50-50%.  |*| *| Sorry*| *|  So you brought this up as an example to show that there are tasks in the family which are, on the other hand, male jobs? Like things developed in a way that he does these jobs and this is the division of work? |*| 25 | R: Yes. So*| *|  take for example my grandparents. In their generation the men never touched the sweeper, or actually, am not sure*| *|  Actually*| *|  they did. Anyhow, but in their generation this was more strictly divided who does and can do what kind of work. And this*| *|  But to say that we share it as 50-50% or that the men should do housework same as women do, or the same amount, this is too much to say*| *|  Let’s say instead that he should do if he wants. And I think most men these days do not take it as demeaning and then I won’t necessarily send my wife back in the house if she wants to spade the snow*| *|  I will let her come out with me but will send her in sooner. She should not spade as much as I do, I will do more of this work and I will carry more stuff when we shop, and she can help if she wants, a little. And*| *|  I won’t consider this work as my own, and she should not consider housework as her own and then I help her a bit in the housework. But I will not do the same*| *|  I am not sure I will do the same amount. Or at least it is not arranged well if it is presented as an expectation that I do the same amount*| *|  |*| 26 | (*| *| ) |*| 27 | R: (*| *| ) But for example if you ask me if I would stay at home with the kids and she would go to work, I find this unimaginable and I wouldn’t like this. Not only because this is a matter of self-esteem, or things like*| *|  but in fact, yes, this would be humiliating for me to know that my wife is the breadwinner*| *|  yes, I think this is part of it too. But also because I think that children need their mother more in the early years than their fathers. |*| 29 | R: No, I wouldn’t. |

Usually men have chests curving outwards*| *|   |*| 4 | R: usually men*| *|  |*| *|  |*| 6 | R: Shoemaker. |*| 8 | R: This is the lay name, the common name for this deformity. The breastbone lies inward more than for average men. |*| 10 | R: Yes, the breastbone. This lies more inward for me. |*| *|  so it was always like this*| *|  I don’t think it affected my physical well-being or performance or endurance, I did not feel this, but by the time I reached 14, at the end of the primary school we talked more and more on having perhaps an operation which would flatten this bone and would give room to my organs. For me the reason was not so much this but cosmetic, so that my chest would look better. Err*| *|  And the story lies perhaps in the fact that the operation was done. Well, first*| *| *|  although perhaps if I have breasts as a girl, maybe then this would not be an issue*| *|  not sure. But I think women are much more sensitive about their physical appearance, to look good, or this is more of an issue for them, they are more “vain” (smiles a bit ironically)*| *|  not sure. So most probably then too I would have*| *|  I was hospitalised for one month as there were some complications with the wound, the scar, it did not want to heal, and this was a pretty rough time for me. For one month I was away from... well, my parents visited me every day but this was a hospital out of our town so it was pretty unpleasant like this*| *|  they could spend half an hour with me every day. It was a difficult time. I think I could stand it better as a boy than a girl could have. Or if I had been a girl. And the reason for my telling this story is the fact that the operation was not really successful. So basically it did not eliminate the hollow from my chest, it is still there, not so deep as it used to be but there is a scar there too, the cut from the operation. And the slow healing, due to which I was in hospital for a month, left a visible mark behind, this is a small scar, a scar from the operation. Err*| *|  And the change that happened after I had left the hospital and the wound had more or less healed*| *|  and my chest had got stronger and I had put on some weight back, so because of some reasons, at a certain point, when I could again go to baths or swimming pools, I decided not to feel ashamed of my chest any longer. And I have not been ashamed of it since*| *| *| *| *|  Errr*| *|  Yes*| *|  And I still don’t know what it was exactly that changed*| *|  this switch in me. The fact that I was no longer ashamed. But somehow it disappeared. Perhaps it’s simply due to my personal development, or perhaps it reflects that boys’ self-confidence is found somewhere else other than their looks. Or perhaps it’s only my character, I don’t know. |*| 13 | (*| *| ) |*| 14 | R: (*| *| ) But the point is that this was a very intense period, which caused some difficulties, yes. And I think the idea was also lingering somewhere in my mind that after all I am a boy, so I have to bear these difficulties, this trial, the idea that a man endures the fact that perhaps his body is weak, or that it’s hard, or that he is alone*| *|  |*| 16 | R: Yes, I did. There were times when I went through immense pain and once*| *|  a few times I cried. |*| 18 | R: No, I didn’t have the “boys don’t cry” thing, not really. |*| 20 | R: Yes*| *|  It was allowed in our family. Yes*| *|  I don’t know. I suffered and then I cried. But*| *|  I was not ashamed for this. Although I did not cry in front of other people, if possible, I cried without other people seeing me. And not many times anyhow. (*| *| ) |*| 21 | (*| *| ) |*| *|  when you had relationships, or girls saw your chest, how did they relate to it? |*| 23 | R: Yes. I need to add that I am not happy with how my chest looks till this day, so I would be happy if it was flatter, or it looked better. Err*| *|  And a few years ago I think I even told myself that this would be a kind of sieve to choose a girl, so that the girl who can accept my chest like this, that girl is a winner, or at least she is certainly*| *|  but then this was not tested as I did not have a girlfriend before my fianc*| é*| e. But I can tell you for sure that the fact that I did not go out with any other girl before her was not due to the fact that I was ashamed of my chest, or that I didn’t want to go to the beach. No, this is more due to my upbringing I think; I was raised in a way that the right thing to do and what pleases God was to marry the person with whom you go out first. |*| 24 | (*| *| ) |*| 25 | R: (*| *| ) I have never experienced any disadvantage out of this after the operation or anything negative.

They took the lead and I did not say much. I did not talk much about myself either to my family, such as what had happened in school, I never really said anything substantial on this (laughs). And I was not the one to initiate things, my leadership qualities did not surface in my childhood. And this was the first time, in this camp for freshmen at university that my leadership qualities showed. Even I was surprised. Although perhaps*| *|  perhaps already in high school, there were occasions when I initiated things or something*| *|  but I did not recognise these. Now, looking back at the camp, I think that there were tasks that needed to be solved in a group work, and girls initiated things*| *|  but I also initiated solutions and came up with ideas. So for example I wrote the lyrics and the tune for our group anthem. Other such things*| *|  Suggesting practical solutions when we needed to solve a problem. And I got a positive feedback right there on the spot from a girl who asked how I could be so smart and how I could have such clever ideas, things like that. This felt good and I still remember it till today; and the reason for my telling you all this is that in the same situation*| *|  that is, I leave behind my familiar environment at home, I travel alone*| *|  although by this time I had already done that, I had been in England as well, and*| *|  I had had a driver’s licence for a long time. In any case, I get into an unknown environment again, though this was not such of a new thing either, and when the time comes, I take the initiative, which I always considered a masculine quality. If I had been a woman, then*| *|  in the same situation, because my idea about a Christian woman is*| *|  |*| 4 | R: My idea about a Christian woman is basically*| *|  Maybe I would not acknowledge this as it sounds chauvinistic*| *|  but still*| *|  probably this is what I think, or these are my stereotypes that a Christian woman, a believer, a good girl would leave the boys to initiate things and she is more quiet*| *|  with “the unfading beauty of a quiet and gentle spirit.” (smiles a littles) So she is quietly there and is active but does not lead necessarily. So, and this was the first step for me when I moved towards leadership, to be an initiator. If I had been there as a woman, a girl, then I would have been a quiet member of the team and that’s it. |*| *|  |*| 6 | R: From the same family, with the same story, with the same character, born as a girl, then it would have happened like that. |*| *|  or did you expect it from yourselves to*| *|  |*| 8 | R: Yes, it somehow came at the time, yes. And I felt this dilemma in me, to move and be an initiator or not. Because I could have just sat there with arms crossed and wait because girls jump in at times like this, this is my experience in life in general, that women fill the space. If the man does not move, then women feel they need to step up and fill the situation and solve it. But I don’t find this ideal. And since then there have been many situations when I had to be an initiator, or lead, or make a step. And I find it fundamentally a masculine thing, something that man should do. |*| *|  |*| 10 | R: Yes, louder and more funny too and*| *|  |*| *|  |*| 12 | R: That too, yes, probably. |*| *|  |*| 14 | R: Yes*| *|  most probably he expected this from his wife to fulfil this role of the Christian woman. And my mother was perfect in this, because basically her character was not that of an initiator. I think my father would not even have married a woman like that, or if he had, there would have been a lot of tension. So they made a good match my father taking the initiative, the leadership. If I use a psychological approach, then he was the dominator, and my mom was the submissive one. Obviously this is not ideal but it made peaceful life together possible. But my father did not expect the same thing from his child, did not expect his own daughter to be quiet, no, they rather let her develop freely. My sister (female name) could develop very well and freely in our family. Although I do not have a large perspective on this as we separated when I was ten. |*| 16 | R: Yes, she married, yes, early. But she played the piano very well, she developed her artistic skills, and she was good as a leader too. Not vis-*| à*| *|  This suits the image I have about her. But now she is married, has been for 10 or 12 years, and she has changed a lot in this respect, she has become quiet and modest and I think she initiates much less than before*| *|  But this is another story. This may not be because of my father, or due to how he raised her, but more due to what her family requires. |*| 17 | (*| *| ) |*| 18 | R: I see, yes. But this does not have to come out in all circumstances and everywhere and all the time but I think... there are spheres where it always have to show, for example in relationships, where I think no woman would like to have a husband who is inert or clumsy. And I don’t think any man would like to be such a man. But in a group, where there are other people, more people, many*| *|  there will be one leader and the rest won’t initiate things. But they will still be masculine*| *|  so*| *|  What I meant is that a man should lead when the situation so requires; then he should get in the frontline, assume the task, initiate and do it. And push things forward. So he should be ready for this. I think this is the problem. I find this a lack in masculinity today, that many men miss this; when they should*| *|  |*| 20 | R: I mean that when the situation so requires, that is, when the situation requires that a man should take the initiative, the leadership, then he is unable to do so. He doesn’t even think of this, or perhaps he feels the lack but he is just frustrated and cannot make a step forward and initiate things. |*| 22 | R: (ponders) I do not want to project this on all women but I think women*| *|  they are happy when a man is there and they lead and they do their*| *|  when they fulfil their role*| *|  So*| *|  this*| *|  Obviously there are women of the leadership type. I know many girls like this, who have this ability to lead and be an initiator, and this is good, but I think even they would be happy to hand over leadership if there is a man who can lead. For example in a group, or in a situation of any type, when there are more people together. |*| *|  |*| 24 | R: And, sorry, yes*| *|  So when there is a group of people and there is no nominated leader in this situation, then*| *|  then it’s*| *|  not that I expect it because I do not expect it*| *| *|  that many times their stimulus threshold is much lower, so they cannot wait that much. And they feel*| *|  they see that the boy does not make a step and then they take the initiative. |*| 25 | (*| *| ) |*| 26 | R: It’s like this*| *|  for example in marriage proposals. Because if it was not like that, then the woman would not say “yes” or then the woman would not answer immediately but she would ask for some more time. If she says “yes” immediately, then this is a sign that she has been ready for this initiative. While the boy has not been ready and that’s why he has waited. Or maybe he just wanted to buy the ring and did not have the money*| *|  anyhow. But*| *|  this can happen in a relationship when organising the program for the weekend, like we should do this or that, should go here or there. Hm*| *|  Yes, this is an issue there a lot. |

Anyhow... so two things came to my mind in connection with this, the first is the fact that when I was working at the time, I earned more then he did. This put him on the ground. Indeed, so perhaps he talked about it only once but this really, really disturbed him, the fact that I was earning more than him, though he earned well too, and it wasn’t like I supported him, or what not, but simply because of this he felt weaker than me. That’s it. The other thing is, that*| *|  (sigh) ya*| *|  that about half of my clothes I was not allowed to wear because how they look, how big the cleavage is, things like that, and so, why I was wearing that thing, that I was showing myself, to everybody, or stuff like that, and then, I talked to a friend of mind who had been with this guy before and that she had gone through the same things with him regarding clothes*| *| *|  so, this whole thing is really not about me, but rather about him, so he had issues, but still, this is, I told you this story because this came up in a relationship , well, in (name of ex boyfriend)’s case it came up pretty strongly, but this comes up in many relationships, and this is not*| *|  so in this case, the issue came up because of (name of ex boyfriend)’s self-esteem. And not because of my behaviour because I acted usual, I mean the same way as before. But then, after this, no*| *|  after this of course I changed, because I constrained myself, and then, well, then my boyfriend came with me to the shop and we bought the clothes he approved. That’s all. |*| 3 | (*| *| ) |*| 4 | R: (*| *| ) well, what is related to masculinity and femininity I think is*| *|  well*| *|  this was the only thing he mentioned at the end, that he always, and always, I think he wanted to prove to himself how potent he was, as he always wanted to have sex and to show with this how strong he was and*| *|  I think it was because of this. What he told me was that many times, or not many times, but at times, he pushed it, well, so when he felt that something was not going well, then he thought that things would get better because of this and that we would get closer to each other, but I think*| *|  after all.. in fact I formulated this idea the first time just now, that I think it had an aspect that I just described. That’s all. And yes, it happened quite a few times, when for me, it had an absolutely opposite impact on me. I am not sure how much this is relevant to the research, maybe more to a psychologist, but I think this was about exercising control and power. |*| 5 | (*| *| ) |*| 7 | R: What happened was that towards the end of the month he told me that he again needed to borrow a few thousand forints from*| *| err*| *|  his mom (laughs), to cover his personal expenses. Then I told him that there was no need for that, that I could give him some money and he did not even need to give it back, but he refused saying that this was his own expense because it was for cigarette as he smoked or for example to invite me for a beer, he needed money for these, and he did not want to borrow money from me for these and I don’ know why he did not want to spend my money on these. I don’t know, this was partly his pride. That’s when the issue came up. |*| 8 | (*| *| ) |*| 10 | R: First, I did not like the fact that he was nagging me with this, that again he would go, ney, ney, ney... the other thing was that I indeed had clothes that I liked because I found them pretty but then I did not wear them. And I thought it was a pity. That’s all. |*| 12 | R: Yes, and especially this feeling of being nagged and things like that, and so, yes, that he constrained me*| *|  yes, this was*| *|  I did not understand why he bothered about this, really, I did not get it first, when this issue came up, like why was this a problem? After all, I do not have*| *|  you've seen me*| *|  I do not have, I am not like*| *|  But not because I had this experience with (name of ex boyfriend) (laugh)*| *|  because if I see a pretty dress then I put that on, I think, or buy it, so things like that*| *|  but*| *|  what did I want to say?*| *|  ah, how it felt*| *|  so really, this control, but this was not only about clothes, but other areas as well*| *|  I felt why the heck he is checking on me and why I could not do this or that, so*| *|  I found it totally nonsense because I did not comprehend it.  |*| 13 | (*| *| ) |*| 15 | R: Look, I thought you would ask me about this because this was the most problematic issue of the whole thing, so*| *|  it was not that he would be too pushy or violent ever, this didn’t happen, but it did happen that we were physically together without me really wanting it*| *|  |*| 17 | R: To avoid arguing, to avoid shouting at each other, crying and shouting, that’s why. (pause) |*| *|  |*| 19 | R: Sure, definitely, of course, till the very end. (pause) |*| 20 | (*| *| ) |*| 21 | R: So what would I pass on to my children? (*| *| ) The other thing, this whole (name of ex boyfriend)-story, I don’ think, or perhaps, yes, it [gender] is also there too, but rather I would approach that from the aspect of relationships, like how one should be in a relationship, what to expect as a minimum, blablabla*| *|  what is it that person A puts in and what is it that person B puts in, perhaps a little bit of psychology, like how to read somebody, so that the limit should be there until you go but not further, so perhaps this is what I took away from this relationship with (name of ex boyfriend), and not only man and woman roles, etc. That’s all. |*| 23 | R: Oh, no, no, I didn’t mean that now. No, no, just in general. So this story with (name of ex boyfriend) did not teach me, or as a morale of this story what I would pass on to my children, both boy or girl, is not men’s roles and women’s roles but how to be with another person in a relationship, that one should respect the other person, stuff like that, all kinds of things about relationships. |

And*| *|  the first time*| *|  so I remember two concrete examples, or two situations like this, when*| *|  well*| *|  in fact it happened more than once when I was a kid, and I had this cropped, short hair all the time, ’cause my mom cropped it short, and then I was taken for a boy more than once, like we were coming to visit my grandma’ in (name of city3) and things like that, and then there was this woman selling pepper or something, and I took a look at what she was selling and then she says*| *| can I help you, little brother?” and then this*| *|  then it really*| *|  I laughed*| *|  and things like that but I realised meanwhile that I got upset when I was taken for a boy. This happened to me I think when I was around 5 or 6, I am not sure, maybe I was older or younger. I can’t remember, I don’t want to say it wrong. So that’s it, and really, after a while I got very uncomfortable when I was taken for a boy. |*| 3 | (*| *| ) |*| *| well, then I will let my hair grow or didn’t you want as kid, didn’t you tell your mom, like, mom, let’s not crop my hair, let it be long. So, didn’t you strive to conform to these codes?  |*| 5 | R: I did let my hair grow, at high school, and first year at university but regarding clothes I still always wore the same. (laughs) But, for example, that was comfortable for me and especially indeed in high school, as a teenager, I always sort of hid my body, you know, in these big T-shirts, and big shirts, and what not, even though I think I had a good figure, quite muscular and things like that, but I always thought I was fat, so*| *|  but what I am saying is that I did let my hair grow but regarding this I did not*| *|  |*| *|  |*| 7 | R: No, no, because I did not consider the whole thing that important. |*| 9 | R: No, it did not disturb me*| *|  but then I realised that*| *|  so once, so when I started wearing feminine clothes then I realised it felt really good. So*| *|  but it really did not disturb me because I liked it comfortable, and we always ran around, in the street, outside, went biking, what not, and I was never a kind of girly girl, I was rather this strong type. |*| 10 | (*| *| ) |*| 11 | R: That absolutely made me upset when, also after university, when I was interning, abroad, among Asians, and I was taken for a man there*| *|  and*| *|  but that too, happened because, well, I was kind of big, compared to them, and I was white compared to them, I was wearing pants, these kinds of office pants, so they were for females, but office pants, so anyways, and I had short hair, and there, no woman has short hair there but*| *|  so, as I said I was also bigger, and white, and then they always said hello in the shops by saying \""Good afternoon, sir\"" |*| 12 | (*| *| ) |*| 13 | R: At that time I had not realised, at that young age, that simply different people have different types of body, and perhaps I had a thick thigh but for example it is not fat and also that I would never have these kinds of toothpick legs and*| *|  so, I had not yet realised this, but otherwise, to answer your question, I did not intervene in a massive way, my mom and dad would always say I was not fat at all and I believed them, or I did not care about this so much. |*| 14 | (*| *| ) |*| 15 | R: Let’s say my mom is a very strong and confident woman and she too, would never use her femininity as a leverage, but she would rely on her brain and the fact that she got along well with people, and that she was cool and well-loved, and indeed she is a clever woman. And she would not, so, how to look like a woman, that I never learnt from her, so perhaps this would be something that I would give a bit more about to my daughter, if I have a daughter, not that I am a super girly woman, but perhaps I could lead her to that, but to lead, this is another question*| *|  (*| *| ) So indeed I miss this, that my mom did not teach me how to be a woman as far as looks are concerned. That is, to be more feminine, or what the beautiful clothes are, what suits my figure, how to wear make-up, blablabla*| *|  These are all formalities and should not be taken to the extreme, but still, I miss them a bit, or at least I did miss them. No problem, I got along just fine without this, and I think I got much more important things, or not much, but important things from my mom (laugh). And really, this is something you can pick up sooner or later by yourself or from female friends or you can look it up how to put on your make up or how to use an eyeliner if you want, just so that it would be a routine, that I miss. |*| 17 | R: Well*| *|  perhaps indeed at university, there I was a slightly feminine woman or girl; there were girls who paid better*| *|  paid more attention at how they looked and then naturally, as they paid more attention at their looks, they were of course more successful. Ok, there was a bunch of girls who were even more like what I was like (laugh). Well, whatever*| *|  this is perhaps where I felt I had a disadvantage. |*| 19 | R: But the fact of how many friends I had did not suffer from this as friends know what is important and what is beneath the surface. |*| 21 | R: This is what I say, yes, at university. |*| *|  |*| 23 | R: Yes, of course. I did not have a lot of successes as a woman. |"
HU_quotes	HU_Q_F_31_PRO	20	0	M�nika Pacziga	13	2	5	1	1	6	0	2	3	2010	4	5	6	4	5	3	4	employer/boss, colleagues, employer as institution	31	*| 1 | HU_Q_F_31_PRO |*| 2 | R: (*| *| ) I work for a firm where there are approximately 200 employees out of which there are, let’s say, about 8-9 women, that is, there are a lot of men. This a research and innovation firm, so they, these men are highly qualified, very clever and intelligent. So*| *|  This is the situation. Here I enjoy the advantage of being a woman (small laugh), and more or less the only woman, because they pay attention at me, and what I say, they are polite with me, very polite indeed, and they are nice, they talk to me, always, and about anything, and if they want to have something arranged, then they have a very positive attitude towards me. Part of this comes from the fact that I am a woman and the fact that there are not many girls, so the few girls that are there are highly appreciated (laugh).(*| *| ) Now the other aspect of this, by the way, this proportion at the workplace, which I do not experience so much because I do not work at that rank, but this firm where I work, the leaders are only men, this is an industrial firm, and the overall proportion of women working there is relatively low, now in the management this is zero, so I mean, there are very very few women there, perhaps one, who has been elected just recently. (*| *| ) So, it’s a fact that if a woman would like to get somewhere, then she will, she would need to put a lot of energy into that. One of my colleagues, she is the head of a group there and she specifically asked for something, like a discussion or something that would help her how she could perform well among men. By the way, she is also a very clever woman, and I think by the way, that she does quite well, and finds a way to communicate with men, but she, well, she*| *|  worked in the army before*| *|  so (laughs) this has something to do with the fact that she is quite*| *| square.” But what I am saying is that there are engineers here and very few women. (*| *| ) |*| 4 | R: She was looking for some kind of training, or*| *|  I once found a forum for her which was about how to be a leader as a woman, how to do that, what tricks there are, what to pay attention, how to be a good leader and not to become masculine, to remain a woman but to achieve her goals. (*| *| ) she explicitly asked for this because she had the feeling in that environment, surrounded by men, so*| *|  she had difficulty achieving what she wanted because she would not, so she would not shout men’s heads off or would not try to be louder than them. |*| 5 | (*| *| ) |*| 6 | R: My opinion is that indeed, these higher level leaders are usually men, or there are many men among them and we often say that they have the time for that, they are able to invest in that, and what not, and they do not have to tend for the family and manage the household and so on, and so on*| *|  and that women, they spend their time and energy on this but I think that many times women do not even have the ambition to choose career instead of the family. I have a colleague, for example, who said that she could never imagine to live for the company instead of, for example, bringing her daughter home from the kindergarten or that she would step by step build her career at the company. And I too, by the way, am like this for now, I am currently not geared to invest a whole lot energy in my career, which is not so good, as I am getting a bit lazy and things like that, but I am doing OK for now, and then we will see... I don’t know. And then when I have kids and family, then I am sure I won’t put more energy into my work than what is necessary*| *|  actually it is not the energy but the time. Not more than necessary. That’s all. So I really think that it is often said that women do not have the possibility but I think that many times women do not even have the ambition for that. Those who do, well, yes, they do have to make a decision to*| *|  this is difficult, it is difficult, but those who are at that level to make such decisions (slight laugh) they are experts at prioritizing, so they must know well what they want. |*| 7 | (*| *| ) |*| 8 | R: (*| *| ) I do not want such a husband who*| *|  I don’t know*| *|  I don’t know*| *|  because I do not think that*| *|  Or, if that is the case*| *|  But I don’t think so*| *|  I think that family is also important for men. Really, I cannot believe that*| *|  those men*| *|  whatever*| *|  What is important for me is that family should be important for my husband. So I do not believe that for those men who choose work instead of family, work is more important than family. Then why do they have a family? So*| *|  A person should be mature to have a family and then they should put themselves there. In my opinion. |

And they also have better chances; they have better chances to get a job there too. |*| 6 | R: They have better sense for this. I can see this with seven years of experience behind me. This is a far cry from sewing but still, women do have better sense for this job. So this is some kind of inborn trait we have, this is genetically coded or god knows, but it’s an interesting thing. So for example men don’t have so much ideas, and, and*| *|  perhaps they are not even that interested in this so much, they just do it because they have to, because they get paid after this. But it makes a difference how you relate to it, whether you do it because you have to or you do it in a way that you also like what you do. So there is a difference between the two things. |*| 8 | R: They definitely have better aesthetic sense in every field, so aesthetically, and in colours too. But regarding perseverance, that, I don’t think it depends on gender. |*| 10 | R: Well, regarding minute work*| *|  that’s sweet*| *|  There are these stones that you can put on nails. And I would have never thought that these are counted by machines. No, we counted them without any visual aid, with our hands and with toothpicks because when they stick together, then you need to separate them. That’s horrible. And then you need to put ten of these into a small bag.  |*| 12 | R: Well,  there were times when for three months it was me who did this job, and at the end I was angry not because I didn’t like the job but because it was so small that for example if you work six hours with it, after three hours, tears will be flooding  your eyes because this is very exhausting for your eyes; and it was always like this person could not do it for this reason, that could not do it for that reason, now there is a difference: is this person not able to do it or does this person just not want to do it, it’s not the same. So in most of the cases they passed this work over to me saying “(name interviewee), please count them.” And (name interviewee) counted them. |*| *|  |*| 14 | R: Well, there has been work about which men declared that they were very sorry but they would not touch this, they would rather go on holiday or sick leave... they would not, they said, they don’t have the patience for this, they were not able to do it*| *|  |*| 16 | R: Very few of them said that they would actually still sit down and try.  |*| 17 | (*| *| ) |*| 18 | R: (*| *| 22 | R: No, no, no. |

Even if I had wanted to become a hair-dresser, or whatever, I could not stand for long enough to do that, so what remained for me were vocations where I could sit. At that time I was not 100 percent into it, but I needed to choose something, you couldn’t stop studying after eight grades, you shouldn’t do that, so I thought then “let me try to become a tailor of women’s clothes.” My attitude was that I would do my best and then we would see if I could do it or not. I was lucky because in the eighth grade, at the end of the school year, when we were over the choosing of secondary school and the graduation ceremony, because, by the way, I attended school among healthy people, and there were no prejudices, they were nice and they accepted me, there was no problem with this. And when we had to submit our applications to the secondary school, then I asked the head of the class “where could I go? No matter how much I want to be a hair-dresser for example, I could not do that.” And then it was me who said, “sewing,” but I had no idea, I grew up in the countryside, I didn’t know what opportunities existed, and then the head of the class was kind enough to have a look and researched this opportunity at the boarding school, which has changed its name since then, it used to be called (name school), and you could learn various trades there, and you could get a high school diploma there, there were workplaces there too, I mean workshops within that building, and then I got into this vocational school, where the teachers came to teach from other regular schools, all right. When the exams came, then we had to go out and take the exam in a different school but when we took the final vocational exam, then the committee came to our school same as with other schools, I think with seven members. There were the same conditions as with quote-unquote “healthy” people, seamstresses; there was no difference. Only that the machines were altered; for example I roll the machine with my elbow, but those whose legs were not that bad, used their legs. And I think that this vocation, this is definitely*| *|  I know there are male tailors too but for this*| *|  this is a real woman’s job because you need to be creative, you need to have ideas, you need to know which colour suits which; so here again it is significant if you are born a woman. |*| *|  |*| 4 | R: Yes, more difficult. |*| *|  I mean to find the right vocation? |*| *|  |*| *|  |*| 8 | R: Yes, yes. |*| *|  studying there I assume |

I have to understand the doctor to some extent though because he told me that now that I was at the end of the nine month period without a problem and the baby being healthy, then he would not like to have a problem during birth because that would not be good either for the child or for me. So I accepted what he said, since he is the doctor after all, and with a caesarean and given a general anaesthetic I gave birth to my little boy. |*| 3 | (*| *| ) |*| 5 | R: Well*| *|  In fact*| *|  |*| 7 | R: Yes, he was a man. I partly blame myself because he had asked me to visit the orthopaedist and bring him a paper on my illness, so after all what is the situation exactly with my hip*| *|  to see if I could widen. My mistake was that I was angry with the doctor who could have given me this paper because I am the victim of an unsuccessful operation. And since then I had tried to avoid that doctor. Now, a doctor who would see me for the first time, would not be able to diagnose me well, he could describe the situation but if I go there 9 month pregnant saying that I wanted this and this paper on my disability and this paper should have said what kind of birth he recommended. Perhaps he would have said “Madam, go to the doctor that had treated you so far because that doctor would know your problem better.” Now since I am angry with him because I think that a doctor should know what operation to do; I accept that they are human beings as well and can make mistakes but to make such a big mistake, you know I could walk and now I cannot*| *|  so it’s not his life but mine. |*| 8 | (*| *| ) |*| 10 | R: Yes, I had an operation in my childhood. |*| *|  |*| 12 | R:*| *|  which was not successful. |*| 14 | R: I was around four years old*| *|  Now when I was born, everything went the same way as with other kids, I started to walk and I walked but I was holding on to the side of the bed and I didn’t want to let it go still when I was around one. This was suspicious. Now my parents took me to the doctor to ask for help, there was no problem with that, as I too as a parent would have done the same. However, the doctor told them that it was a simple operation and he suggested he do it. But I could walk; only I put my legs crossed. So I did not put my legs side by side but crossed. I did not fall though, I just walked that way. He said he would correct that and I would be able to walk normally and I wouldn’t have any problem. Now what happened is that he cut the main nerve in both of my legs and I lost my balance as a result. And from that point onward, after they had removed the plaster, then they brought the wheelchair for me to sit in. I was only four but I protested. And in fact I learnt how to walk by myself. This was very interesting because the first time it took me two hour painstaking effort till I managed to stand up but I succeeded. I was holding on to the wall and tried to walk very slowly. (*| *| ) |*| 16 | R: Yes, they did, of course, as the X-ray showed that they have cut the main nerve and as a result I was losing my balance. Now at that time it was not in fashion to sue doctors. |*| 17 | (*| *| ) |*| 19 | R: These experiences were quite mixed because I can tell you that there were doctors who related to me as to any other woman and treated me as a woman, a lady, whatever way I put it, and that they had the same attitude and didn’t discriminate but there were others whose face showed “what the heck is this doing here?” |*| 21 | R: Well, this is an interesting thing because when I gave birth, it was a male doctor and I was happy with him, indeed he did everything during those nine months too. But then later the problem was that he moved from where he practiced and I couldn’t follow him to the new place because the new place was on one of the upper floors and there was no elevator in the building, so unfortunately we had to say good bye. And since then through an acquaintance I have had a gynaecologist from (name hospital) who is a woman. I find her a very nice person; perhaps I can discuss problems more easily with her, especially because she is a woman, so more than with a man. But in fact it is this aspect; I find it easier to open up and talk to a woman, somebody of the same sex, than to a man. This is my experience. |

The disadvantages for me came not from the genders unfortunately but from health problems. This did not begin in childhood but rather in my adolescent years... and when I felt that, when I saw that other children went running and biking, I had to live without these; however, when one grows older, one will see this differently and will realise that one needn’t worry about this, at the most, one needs to be happy that other people can do what one cannot. |*| 3 | (...) |*| 4 | R: I will tell you a story that not many people know about, in fact, only the ones who are really close to me. So everybody is born somewhere, to a place, and I think your fate is sealed at your birth. I have realised why it is so. As I was growing up, still as a child, when I was nine years old, I had to realise that my mother was not ill, because my father used to tell me that my mother was ill, but in fact she was drinking very heavily. Now as a result, she was not interested in the family or housework, so all this, beginning from my childhood, so the cooking, the cleaning, whatever I could do, more and more of the household chores fell on me. And my mom realised that there was somebody who would do the housework, so she neglected it even more. So unfortunately she is not that kind of mother about whom you could say that she is a mother. This sounds bad from me as I am a mother as well but this is the truth.  |*| 6 | R: I had to do it because my father worked in three shifts and after he got home, we were living in the countryside and we had animals and a garden, so he didn’t even know what to do, whether to run to the garden or to feed and give water to the animals, so he had his hands full and he could not have cooked as well. Sometimes my older sister did the housework too, but not too often because she was more into books, was always reading, and I myself, because I really liked my father, I always had the feeling that my father should be able to eat when he gets home. This was my primary goal, so it was not so much for myself but rather this great love of my father, this was what motivated me; this is the way I can put it, that if there was somebody who loved their father, then this was me, I cannot even put this in words. My feeling was that I had to thank him for everything, also the fact that I have become such a person, the way I am. This can all be traced back to his support and help because he was my mother instead of my mother and also my father in one person. (laughs bitterly) |*| 10 | R: Well, it was much more difficult for me because what takes let’s say an hour for somebody to do, and especially in my childhood, but still, even now, it takes more times for me to cook a meal than for a person who is healthy and can use both their hands and legs, as I use a wheelchair now and that is how I move around and take the dishes and everything, so more time. |*| 12 | R: Well, she found a job when I finished the eighth grade because she used to take me to school by bike as my father used to work in three shifts, so he could not really take me to school, so my mom took me to school and brought me home. I finished the eighth grade and then I continued in a boarding school in Budapest and then my mom found a job. She had a job earlier and she wanted to have employment status so that she could get pension when she gets old.  |*| 15 | (...) |*| 17 | R: Not really. What happened is that when I was in secondary school, in vocational school, on the threshold of becoming an adult, then when the exam period started, I was not permitted to leave the dormitory; they told my father that he could not take me home because whenever I went back to the dorm from home on Sunday I was so tired; and that I should just stay in the dorm so that I could successfully take the exams and then when I had finished all the exams then I could go home. |*| 19 | R: Well, the usual problems. It didn’t matter that we didn’t see mom every day, I mean that I didn’t see her every day.. I shouldn’t’ have used the plural. Still I was happy to go home every Friday but then around five or six o’clock I realised that oops, she again chose alcohol and not me and then again the same problem, which had already been there, that is, cooking, cleaning, laundry, all this was my job to do. My sister no longer lived with us at that point, she had married and moved on, so by that time it was all my job, and then during the weekend I tried to make two or three different meals and all I could think of was father and that he would have something to eat. So it is always in the singular, because I missed that motherly love and I still miss it today. I don’t know what that is. |

All my dream was from the time when I was a bit more mature, I phrase it like that because this is not connected to age, even though they say that a person at age 18 is an adult, but I think that this is nor certain because it is a person’s mind, their thinking that determines how mature somebody is, so all my dream was to have a child who is healthy, because I did not want an unhealthy child for sure*| *|  so if I had known in advance that my child would not be healthy, then I would not have kept it, because I was thinking that I did not want him or her to go through the same as I did, although I am an anti-abortion person, I have to add that, and I think a life should not be taken away from a child or the beginning of a life, the foetal life, because that is a life even at that time but if there are problems, then I actually agree with it. Now, because this was my dream, related to this, I had a problem as a young girl, with my period, I menstruated three times a month, I went to the doctor a lot, child gynaecologist and adult gynaecologist, they did not find the problem, they didn’t know the reasons why it was like that, then they experimented with many different kinds of medications, then finally they prescribed the weakest contraception, which they said would regulate a 28 day cycle; they had no other ideas. Due to this I feared that given that I want a baby, I would need to stop the medication and there is no guarantee that*| *|  my body should be cleaned of this medication, that I could conceive immediately after, or God forbid, the unwanted irregular menstruation comes back and then I won’t have the chance. So with this*| *|  not so much a fear but rather with a difficulty I began this project because I really wanted this and thank God, if I wanted anything, if I really wanted that, then I had to succeed. And I was very lucky indeed, I met my current husband*| *|  at my girlfriend’s place*| *|  it was a*| *|  birthday or name-day party, some kind of occasion and he was there, well, I did not take him seriously, actually not at all, because there is a big age difference between us*| *|  so I thought, OK, we are friends, and not more, but then this friendship, because it was friendship on my part for a while and I did not take it seriously, then time passed and still, somehow, I would say, the ice broke, and then I said “I don’t care if he is older; he has proven that he is a nice and considerate man” and the other thing is that he also has a health problem, so I thought there would not be anything to blame each other for*| *|  So then I decided to give it a chance and I was the one to come up to him and tell that I wanted to have a child and I asked him to answer if he wanted one because if not, then I would look for somebody who would. This might sound strange from a woman’s mouth, but since this was my dream, I wanted to realise this at all cost. Then he said that he needed a month to think it over since he already had a daughter from a previous marriage, but unfortunately his first wife had passed away, so he had more experience by that time in child rearing, so had a base and I didn’t. But then he made up his mind to have a child and not because I wanted it and I was lucky with (name son) so to say because in February I stopped taking the pills and on April 6th I went back to the doctor being in the 6th week of pregnancy. So this was a miracle indeed, I don’t know how, given the circumstances, which I have told you about*| *|  I was very very happy, and I went to see the doctor, I said I would do everything to have a healthy child and I told him to be honest and tell me if there were complications but I asked him not to jump to conclusions when he sees me and he sees my problems and perhaps he wants to discourage me from giving birth, because I said if the doctor talked like that, then it’s not that I didn’t believe him but I would go and ask three or four doctors and if three or four doctors would tell me the same then they indeed would be telling that because there were problems and not because they, seeing my condition, want to dissuade me from giving birth. So I was very happy. (*| *| *| *| ) And then everything happened so quickly, and I got to the hospital in the last minute, so to say, with pains in every two minutes. I did not want to have a caesarean, not at any cost. I have to understand the doctor to some extent though because he told me that now that I was at the end of the nine month period without a problem and the baby being healthy, then he would not like to have a problem during birth because that would not be good either for the child or for me. So I accepted what he said, since he is the doctor after all, and with a caesarean and given a general anaesthetic I gave birth to my little boy. I could not believe my eyes. (starts to cry) This is so interesting as it seems as if it had happened today*| *|  (cries) Sorry*| *|  He was 51 centimetres and four kilograms and I said to myself, “this is a miracle.” And I kept asking “Is he my child?” I was told there were no other babies to mix him up with as he was the only baby in the hospital. I said to myself I had not expected this much from myself. But it was indeed like that. And you know when one can cry over this after 13 years and can relive the whole thing that happened*| *| *|  do. And then I said to myself, when I saw my little boy, that I felt like a healthy person, a person who has no limits. I was happy, I could see that he was healthy, he had his arms and legs, everything was all right, and then I said “My God, I got my legs back!” I cannot put it in other words. So what I had lost, somehow I got back in him. And until today I feel proud to have him. I am proud of myself too because the doctor’s words come back to me when he said “You should be very happy because there are women who would do anything to have a child but they cannot make it because there are some problems but you were stronger and you made it.” And the doctor himself did not believe that I could make it, he admitted that I was the first patient in his life to have a problem due to being handicapped and he admitted later that he was more afraid of this whole thing that I could imagine. And somehow this, this is a*| *|  a very*| *| 4 | R: Well, I really wanted to have one more. When (name son) was about two or three years old, I was telling my husband that (name son) should have a brother or sister, he should not be an only child; I really wanted to have a little girl. OK, since there was a big age difference between him and me, more than 13 years, and also our financial situation was very bad at the time, so we really had to calculate what we spent the money on, so that we could make ends meet, and pay all the bills, have enough food and anything that the family may need and is important. My husband said that at his age he did not want to take on this responsibility because by the time both had grown up, he would be a grandfather. So we have (name son) as an only child for me. My husband has two children as he has a daughter too, but in retrospect I feel sorry that I didn’t stand my ground stronger. OK, the financial aspect I admitted, the fact you have to cut your coat according to your cloth, but I am very sorry to have only one child. |*| 5 | (*| *| ) |*| 6 | R: I could walk, all right, not without an aid, so with two sticks and my medical paper said that I could not walk more than 50 metres, that is, my legs could not take more than that with two sticks. So I am partially responsible to end up in a wheelchair because I took 3 buses and I also walked to get from district (numer1) to district (number 2) to get to my workplace so that I could provide for the family, for my kid, my husband and myself, so that our apartment would not be taken away from us, so that we could pay the important things such as diapers, food, and we would have everything and that this child would not miss anything. I did this for six year, all year round, in snow and ice, and of course it was not 50 metres I walked. If the bus broke down on (name square), then I had to walk to the next stop, and this was quite hard. I did this for the family. So I did this*| *|  |*| *|  |*| 8 | R: My husband had his pension and I had pension but till today I say that if I did not have a job, then we would have a very difficult life because the utilities are very high. |*| 10 | R: No, he didn’t, no. My husband stayed at home and he stayed with my two and a half year old son and I couldn’t wait either to get home, and the only bad thing was that sometimes we had to stay in longer, like before Christmas or Easter, before big holidays, from 6 in the morning till 10 in the evening. This was really hard because when I left home, my son was still sleeping and by the time I got home, he was already sleeping. So for two weeks I only saw my son sleeping and then I had enough and told my boss that I didn’t care, I could be fired, I don’t mind, I had seen my child only sleeping for two weeks and I was going home. |*| 12 | R: Yes, it was, of course it was, that company*| *|  |*| 14 | R: No, they didn’t. That company was totally different because the whole world was different at the time, eleven years ago. |*| 15 | (*| *| ) |*| 17 | R: Well, yes, there were conflicts because I think that a child needs their mother first of all. He or she needs a father too but they are more attached to their mother especially at that age. I would really have liked to stay at home and rather wanted my husband to go to work but he could not have done that job which I was doing because he has problem with one of his hands as well and it was impossible to do that work with one good hand only, and unfortunately money decided, and the fact the we needed the money to make ends meet and we had to choose, which was very difficult. But this was the right decision because in this way my child did not miss anything and I never had to tell him “My son, I cannot buy you that piece of chocolate because we don’t have the money.” |*| 19 | R: Yes, that’s when I started. |

The reason why I find it important to mention that the ethnic battle was going on between the Roma and the Hungarians*| *|  this man, whom I am talking about, was chosen and appointed by the local powers as a*| *| voivod,” leader of the Roma, or so they tried, though of course there was no*| *| voivod” in the village, as there are no*| *| voivods” in general, but they thought that it is a Romani man who should keep order among the Roma. This man I am talking about was a well-to-do, well-respected man, he had horses and other animals and he had a kind of prestige among the Hungarian farmers as well. Still, he had a very strong identity as a man, or rather a Roma, a Romani man. And this is the crux of the story, he himself relates, that he never changed the diaper for his own children, never fed them while they were young, that is, babies. It was when the children were around three to four years old, and they had their own will, and they could walk, and perhaps could help him, or even when they were older, it was then that he started counting them as human beings. However, and here is the crux of the story, one of his sons, the one that he perhaps thought to be the most talented and the one he liked the most, died in a family tragedy and he left a babygirl behind, who was around*| *|  at the time of our visit, was a bit over two years old. And the man showed us the bicycle they had bought for the child, which she could use later when she was able to ride a bicycle, but what he really told us was how the birth of this girl had changed him. That is, until that point, things he had never done, he started doing with this babygirl – the baby was around 2-3 months old when they took her in the family. And of course, there is the element of a Greek tragedy of fate, that is, they had wished for a girl but it was always boys, boy, boys being born and finally, with the death of their son, they get a girl. This well-built, I can say, big man, suddenly starts talking about how you need to change the diaper for a babygirl, how carefully you need to wipe her buttocks and put the cream on, because a babygirl is much more sensitive than a boy, and what you see, what I see is that logically I relive my own gender roles, and my status as a man among men in my own village comes to mind, so what is really interesting is*| *|  but let me finish this story first, so it was simply moving and I experienced how a man changes with time and how he changes his own gender roles. So it was a taboo for him to tend for babies and young children, just as it was a taboo at the time in that village for a man to wash dishes.  So a man who washes dishes performs a woman’s job, thus is not manly, not masculine. And now of course you do not need to connect this to Roma only. I immediately remembered, the story within a story, that, well indeed, when I am at home in (name village2), we live in a village, and so it happened that when we were slaughtering a pig, or the neighbour’s pig, I started doing the dishes by myself without a word. Seeing that, my own friends, my buddies, for example at the house where we were slaughtering the pig, started teasing me like*| *| look, (name interviewee) is doing the dishes, it is women who do dishes.” And this is a conscious choice for me of course to*| *|  I go against the role they assign for me or for men in a given community of men and women when, while of course making women happy, I do the work they do and are supposed to do in this strict gendered division of work. I go against certain taboos, or I go against and change taboos by doing the dishes. Both stories are about this; the first is about a man who changes the image held about him in his community and openly goes against the current by tending for the little baby, the young child, by creaming her buttocks, changing her diaper, by bathing her; and I openly go against this strict male community, accepting that I would be an object of ridicule, by doing the dishes because for me it is a matter of principle to participate in a shared work with my family. |*| 3 | (*| *| ) |*| 4 | R: What I experienced in this story is how a man’s own*| *|  Ok, I experienced two things: I experienced my own gender roles vis-*| à*| -vis what a man living in a different culture thought about his own gender roles; and I also experienced how this man’s gender roles had changed in consequence of a tragedy and a gift-grandchild and it also brought up several memories when I had faced the value of my own culturally-influenced gender roles vis-*| à*| -vis another community’s cultural or gender roles.  |*| 5 | (*| *| ) |*| 6 | R: I think we attribute too much importance to gender roles. So what is more at issue is the fact that somebody tries to deconstruct it – because I think that this whole story is about how I experience that somebody develops a different set of roles or chooses a different one vis-*| à*| -vis his own earlier gender roles. (*| *| ) What I saw was that here is this man, grown into a world, lives in this world and that the rules, the norms, the values, the taboos of this world suddenly loses their validity and a new system, a new order is being built, where he revisits and changes his earlier acts, choices and non-choices. And in this sense, well, I have already mentioned a bit that through my relatives, or through my work I have many times been among people living in the countryside, in a rural environment and among Romani people as well and obviously different cultural norms and value systems operated there, in a certain sense, older, more archaic, if you like, more traditional, so*| *|  and I also told you this, I can or could look at this from two angles, exactly because I grew up in a double culture. So, what was powerful for me in (Name1)’s story is the human dimension of the whole thing, if you like, the literary or artistic dimensions. And in this sense, of course, when one is confronted with, or perhaps not confronted, but if one compares one’s own choices with the choices of a different community, then they are always in a certain sense questioned, or confirmed, or they are confirmed by the questioning. And indeed I was not shaken in my choices. (*| *| ) |*| 7 | (*| *| ) |*| 8 | R: (*| *| ) So I was confirmed to the extent that, see, a man, older than me, can also confront his own incapacity or taboos and how he can change, how this little child can bring about a small change, how he can face this, how he can recount this, how he can talk about this. So, this feeling of liberation, this frankness, this self-criticism was immensely captivating, beyond the fact when you see somebody change and see somebody talk about themselves totally frankly. This was the confirmation. |

My brother and I sometimes stayed in school till the evening for school day care, but when we were older, we didn’t. But there were three men for one woman. As a result, I very soon learnt the joy and labour of cleaning or doing the dishes, what’s more I can also tell you that when*| *| *| inferior” parts eaten by women. So for example the wings, the back and the buttocks are for women, while the thighs and the breast are for men. In our family my father and my*| *|  not as if our family was some kind of rigorous family, but still, so it happened that my younger brother would rather eat the breast, my father would eat the thighs and my mother and I would eat the back and buttocks, which I really like till today, in fact, I love these parts the most. But I am wandering away from the dishes. But what I want to tell you is that in a family where men are in a majority, it seems that some men automatically will start doing certain female work and will assume certain female roles, with which they will make a balance, as there are few women and a lot of men and then certain men will move towards jobs which are considered women’s work in a rigid society. |*| 4 | (*| *| ) |*| *| ) You mentioned in a previous story that you*| *| grew into” doing the dishes and some other kinds of work which are traditionally not considered*| *| male work” or male role. What I wanted to ask is, what was the thing that reinforced you in this besides growing into it, did you see a pattern to follow, what was it that reinforced you to help your mother? (*| *| ) You mentioned one thing before; the number, the proportion of men and women in the family (*| *| ) |*| 6 | R: Well, I think it was my mom and dad. And yes, I think that if there are many men and many women in a community, then indeed it is easier to have these rigid male and female roles. For example if there is a big wedding celebration and there are thirty women who cook the soup, the cabbage, make the pasta and do a myriad of things for the 300 guests, then it is crystal clear that there is the female chorus who do all these and there is the male chorus who cut the wood for the fire, make the fire, build the tents, slaughter the pig, and I could go on, so in certain situations society operates on cooperation that is set up according to skills, knowledge, physical strength, delicate work or needs. When there is a family of four, then this is not a mass, so there is no possibility for male and female work there, of course everybody brings the knowledge of what would be if there was a big community here, 200 people, or maybe just 20, so perhaps if there had been two girls in our family besides us two boys, then perhaps things do not have turned that way that I would do the dishes, well first i wiped the dished, then I washed them, then I cleaned. So*| *|  and probably also the fact that I was the older one and I expressed solidarity*| *|  well*| *|  solidarity is a big word*| *|  I loved my mother and one way to show that was to be obedient, or to try to make her happy, or when I felt that she could not do or was not at home to do the work and she asks me, then I would do it. So in this sense, I had no idea on what a boy was allowed to do and what not, what he was supposed to do and what not. So socialization formed me gently like yes, I see the woman working on something, she asks me to help, then I am beside her, then I see how she is doing something, and then the next time I can*| *|  so my brother and I could make a meal before our father, who*| *|  as I have said is the first to have a college degree in his family, which lived in a village and for him it was not obvious to cook. I think he cannot really make scrambled eggs even*| *| But perhaps I make a myth out if it. But he came with this that this was not his job. He would leave that to his wife. And I came with thinking that this could be my job as well, why not? Of course, as I said, I cannot sew with a machine. When I was in the military, I used to sew the button on my shirt, but after I got married I have not really sewn any buttons. Which means that there is a little in us that prevents us from becoming women or feminine. The same way as there are many things in women that make them be like men, but there is still the essence of the thing as a result of which they have not become men or are not becoming men daily. |

I lived in a bad marriage, and at that time I had already struggled in it for a long time, and then there was this father with four children, a friend of mine with a small palinka-making business in the countryside, who in fact*| *|  did not exactly shake me in my conservative idea of fatherhood but rather, he suggested me an alternative saying that even if I divorce from my wife, I would not cease to be the father of my children. Until then I used to think that I could not have a divorce as then I would not be the father of my children. This man showed me an alternative*| *|  of course I knew a lot of divorced men but I did not want to be a divorced man like them*| *|  but this man said that you do not lose your children by divorcing your spouse, and he showed me this alternative of why couldn’t the children live with me once I divorced. Of course, they did not live with me but regardless of this, I have always had a very close relationship with my children and will have, in fact now also with my grandchild*| *|  And when I saw this old man who had accepted his grandchild in their family, seeing that I was struck with the feeling like, fuck, excuse my word, that after all, I lost my daily, frequent contact with my children, which I used to have before. So there is this male role, fatherhood, which I used to take very seriously but still not so much that I would stay in that marriage. So I think that a story which you experience and identify with intensively will make you rethink or question some of your earlier choices; like, did you make a good decision then?

Did it really serve their interest? |*| 3 | (*| *| ) |*| 4 | R: I didn’t know that they would not be*| *|  I was certain*| *|  I was convinced that the children would stay with me. As a father, I felt to be their mother much more than their own mother. And the simple reason for this was that she was already working at the courts and spent much more time at her workplace, with her work, and I felt that I was paying much more attention at the children and I thought that I was much more of my children’s partner, I talked their language more, and I knew more what they needed, and they were more attached to me*| *|  but the court in 1986-87 was more likely to rule in favour of a mother especially if that mother was a judge herself. So*| *|  I did not really take these unfavourable circumstances into account.

So there, part of the so called female work was done by her, and the other part was done by me. My wife was a full-time mother until the children were small and then she went to work and she no longer did a lot of work, which, according to a traditional female role, would have belonged to her, or*| *|  plus there was her mother, who did this, but I also took a share and I liked to do certain tasks, be it cooking, cleaning; I cleaned my room and the children’s room, I have already mentioned that I did the laundry for the kids and myself, and I ironed their and my clothes, I also used to do at the time some carpentry work, like I made a bed, a double bed, and bookshelves. Perhaps there is one thing I am good at, and this is carpentry, while I cannot fix a car. And here, where I live currently, in (name village2), we run a big farm, here I do not wash clothes, I do not iron, but I do the dishes, I dig in the garden, I look after the animals. If there is anything that is strictly my job, then this is the cleaning of the animals and the cages or what*| *|  for the animals. There are not*| *| *|  ok, this is a different issue that I am not that particular with*| *|  with some things I am, like I put things in their place.

And of course, not all male who happen to be in this community due to the fact that they belong to the male sex, and I will give you the concrete examples in a second, will behave according to this masculine behaviour. The first story: perhaps fourth grade in high school, after P.E. class or a football game, we were having a shower. And all of us, collectively, got a reprimand from the head teacher because in the men’s shower, which is a typically male world, as much as the women’s shower room is a female world, so men do two things in the shower: they either talk about women, perhaps their own sexual escapades, or they literally behave obscenely, and perhaps*| *|  We were singing an obscene song, which was actually not that obscene, but it was very loud under the shower, in the steam we screamed*| *| my trousers have thirteen endings” and then the refrain goes*| *| you see, my darling, you screwed the legs of my trousers, or what.” And this echoed out into the corridor and then came the head teacher, she came in the men’s*| *|  well, the boys’ shower, and then everybody was trying to cover themselves, and some boys did not try to cover themselves*| *|  well, the point is, what I want to say is, that there is a milieu where men suddenly start acting masculine and there are men for whom this kind of masculine behaviour is not attractive, and they do not shout, and when, half-drunk, they do not talk about their sexual escapades, they do not expose their ex lover or girlfriend or one-time partner, or just their road-side adventure, then they go against a general, or no, not general, just a certain type of male behaviour. Another milieu like this is the military, which is even more severe than a simple shower after a P.E. class or football game. What I often think is that perhaps one’s true self manifests in such out of the ordinary but still general milieus, when you are with the members of your own sex in a segregated, military segregated way and the question is if you can still keep your human face or you sink into obscenity, molestation, name calling, physical abuse*| *|  and I haven’t even mentioned that in youth camps, also when I was in secondary school, the older boys used to have this game to scratch each other’s genitals in the shower, or during or after the football game. So there are these manly games and there are men who do not participate in these games. These are opportunities to consciously learn how to become a macho man, a socialization scene to become a macho; in these opportunities one can decide if one would like to become a macho man or not, if one would like to become a dominant male who shows his masculinity verbally as well. So I think these are confrontational moments in one’s life. (*| *| ) |*| 3 | (*| *| ) |*| 4 | R: (*| *| ) one can see that certain men, and I don’t, I never say that men in general, behave like this. What I am saying is that there are men who behave like this, and others who behave like that. And one starts making categories and groups and will try to place onself in one of these. So while I do have a male consciousness, obviously, beginning from my sexual orientation, the things that I do and am interested in, which are associated in some way with male roles, male choices, but in all these there are also the things I do not expect and do not do. So the fact that I do something which I should not do according to a different male thinking, this is a choice. So there are confrontations not only between male and female roles but among various male roles. (*| *| ) |

One isn’t really conscious what the real difference is, right*| *|  these are early*| *|  I have early memories from my kindergarten years that we boys were treated differently already in kindergarten, and this is a*| *|  this was very important in my life. For a good while it had a kind of negative influence on me, the fact that I had to realise that even in our very early years girls were treated somewhat more kindly, and the boys were treated more roughly and strictly and this made me upset too and implanted some kind of fury and spite against girls. Like every other boy, I was also expected to be polite with girls, to give them way, to leave the more delicious part of the meal for them and*| *|  I rebelled against this: but why? Since girls at the same time were pert, they were telling on us, so*| *|  they showed many strange features, which in childhood, in a boys’ circle, which at that point separated itself from girls, was found to be strange and confusing. The other thing was, and this was very strange too, that there were the boys’ games and the girls’ games, so we rarely mixed in common games*| *|  now, this has a significance only from the point that I experienced that during our games, beginning from my early childhood till my adolescent years, we were dirty, our games were louder, and we were dirty and our clothes were torn, while the girls playing next to us were neat and clean and fresh and with an air of refinement they separated from us, and they made comments and all this had an impact on me that made me think that perhaps girls are a bit superior, the heck with it*| *|  and when I was growing older and becoming a bit brighter and beginning to be interested in girls, then this translated into the question: “What might be they thinking?” Then the girls were whispering, I was trying to learn what they might have said, about whom and what, and there was only one girl-friend who stuck out, I need to say friend, with whom we grew up together in the same building, who has passed away unfortunately and who was two years older than me, who was an immensely versatile person with extraordinary abilities, this girl, (female name1), with whom we had a life-long friendship, who surprisingly, wanted to step out of this girly role and always wanted to play with us, so she played boys’ games, she wanted to have boy roles and for a long time could not accept herself as a girl. And*| *|  she was always checking it with me – we were very close friends – in what way she was different from boys. So she participated in games which were strictly for boys, like fighting games or football. She was very skilful, was good at sports, but sooner or later in the end she became a girl and acted as a woman. And later she did not have a problem with this. So, she pronounced her femininity, became a feminine woman, later she told me about her loves, also told me about her family life, she had a very bad marriage, poor soul. So this was a kind of strange experience. Well*| *|  the boys and girls from this building for a long time*| *|  after the separation in the adolescent years, love stories began to emerge, and this is so strange, sometimes these days I meet the girl who was my love at the time and even till this day it feels like I had an electric shock when I meet her*| *|  even though it was 50 years ago. And*| *|  when I see this woman, now she is also an adult and her children are adults*| *|  err*| *|  I have this feeling as if women were superior. That is, her purity, her simplicity, I don’t even know how to phrase this*| *|  this idea was connected to women for me in my childhood. |*| 3 | (*| *| ) |*| 4 | R: No, I felt I belonged here, that is, to boys. Because within the boys’ club, I was kind of a dominant person due to my age and physique*| *|  hm*| *|  no, but still, it was hard on me that girls were always so pure and clean*| *|  in the rare occasions*| *|  I noticed if they used bad language, that is, they didn’t use bad language. We did, we shouted, we were loud and*| *|  we had fights and this was rare with girls. (*| *| )*| *|  I felt some kind of pain about not having this purity, so this was like this*| *|  and indeed it made me feel as if something eluded me and I could never capture that. |*| 5 | (*| *| ) |*| 6 | R: (*| *| ) I grew up in the old system of schools, that is, until I was 10, we went to co-educated school, then I had female friends, but I suffered at the time as well that teachers were pampering the girls like “oh, my dear little girl” (gives a kiss sound) and to us: “go away rowdy boys”*| *|  So, this happened like this, then the co-ed classes were gone and I went to an all-boy class and then we were just peeping after girls, but*| *|  we never really dared to initiate anything*| *|  we were shy*| *|  little boys. And indeed, for relationships*| *|  Also when I went to secondary school, I also went to an all-boy class. (*| *| )*| *|  when I went to university, then again it was a co-ed environment, and then it was difficult to get used to this mixed environment with girls. I did not initiate relationships, right, so in the end*| *|  a girl from our year*| *|  was the one who picked me, and then we were together*| *|  until we graduated. Then we separated.  |*| 7 | (*| *| ) |*| *|  so for example, your friend (female name1), who was someone who entered a male a world, how did you take when somebody left a traditional gender role? So when a girl did not adapt to this traditional girly world? |*| 9 | R: The truth is that we were very close friends, so I could afford to tease her on that. So*| *|  I teased her*| *|  Like go away, you are such a*| *|  |*| 11 | R: Well... |*| 13 | R: Strange, yes. But*| *|  Now, I have to admit that I once*| *|  there was a time when I felt that I was in love with her. And I even told her this. So this was no problem. But then this passed and then*| *|  we played on. So*| *|  With her*| *|  She was the only girl from whom I did not separate in my adolescent years. So we met when we were adolescents, even when every normal boy was just socialising with boys and played football only with them and if there was a girl involved, then it must have had some sexual component. So*| *|  (Female name 1) was an exception in this*| *|  And I truly miss her. Imagine that all my experience with literature, my world view was influenced by her. Not because she somehow*| *| ”read this because*| *| ” No, no, no. We were just talking on something and she made me curious about things.  |*| 14 | (*| *| ) |*| 16 | R: No, it didn’t, I loved her a lot, also as an adult. She was kind of frivolous, although she was not a beauty, but still... I loved the fact that she immediately saw the back side of things. She was an excellent chess player. We used to play chess sometimes. And then*| *|  She was better at it than me, and I always remembered when I could beat her*| *|  Yes, and it drove me mad when she laughed*| *|  so she always used to laugh. And if she was successful or beat me, then she laughed and then this*| *|  this made me feel like*| *|  will bite your throat. But really*| *|  she was super. And she had an impact on my childhood and also on my adulthood. |*| 17 | (*| *| ) |*| 18 | R: This is a very strange story. This seemed to have been repeated later at a different level. With my own child in his early school years, when the teacher paid special attention at girls. She was much kinder to them, let them get away with more, and judged them much more favourably. If there was a Christmas performance, then girls got bigger roles in that, they made clothes for them for this occasion. They taught girls, and only girls, special and very spectacular songs, but beside this, one could see that girls had better results at school, which was most probably not due to their skills, but the teacher found girls more pleasant*| *|  so much so that even my own son remarked that “daddy, why did x and y get better grade than I while she did not perform better than I and why am I told off for something that this girl is praised for*| *|  so this is how it manifested. And it wasn’t only him, the other boys noticed this too. We in fact took him from that school, to (name school), where, interestingly, this was not a fashion at all. So they did not differentiate there. This is a very good school with very empathic and well-trained teachers. When we changed schools, the former teacher was hurt and said that she did not like alternative schools. The sweet thing was that she did not like alternative schools but it turned out that she was the professional trainer for the young teachers at (name school). |

Mmm*| *|  So this made my future relationships more difficult, and there were very few women who were willing to tolerate this, well, my current partner was one of the few exceptions, but I overheard a conversation when her female friends tried to dissuade her from starting a relationship with me, who was divorced and had a child already*| *|  |*| 3 | (*| *| ) |*| 4 | R: (*| *| ) And I was there every evening*| *|  or rather, not only in the evening but the afternoon as well. |*| 6 | R: Yes, as I finished work, well, by that time I had my own business, but yes, even if I was in the countryside, when lunchtime was approaching, then I started off and was hurrying home to give lunch to my baby, and then in the afternoon I played with him till the evening.

And then*| *|  he had crisis sometimes, when something was very difficult, then I tried to, if nothing else, tried to cheer him up.

An independent man. And when we talk about old times, I am sad to realise that he hardly remembers anything from our fun together, the football games, the excursions, he only remembers that well, once when we played football together, then I scored beautifully once.

(*| *| ) the wife left the husband for another man and left the three children behind*| *|  (*| *| ) So in my case, I did not visit my child, I lived there with my child. I went there in the afternoon*| *|  I accommodated to his rhythm. He first liked to relax a bit, he was a good student, so he did not have to be forced to do his homework first and then allowed to play, no.

We get together sometimes, like we celebrate family events together here*| *|  she comes here for these till the very day... like the kids’ birthdays, either kids’ birthdays, Christmas, so then she is here. She takes my kid for a walk, I mean my second child*| *|  She would like to come today too*| *|  So she is a pensioner but still works*| *|  So I keep a close relationship with her and*| *|  I feel guilty too that the whole thing turned out this way*| *|  Because this is selfishness. I know if she had married, I would not have had so much of my child, because then I would have been in the way. And most probably she knew this. So*| *|  (sighs) It is a strange situation.

And now and then this came to my mind during my career path... Because as a man, I also experienced that I had a much bigger playing field. So, I am not... |*| 4 | R: So, for example, I could work on ships, I could go abroad anytime, anytime, stay as long as I wanted...

So*| *|  if there was a party, I didn’t have to rush home, or if... for example, when... I was sent to work abroad several times, I could leave anytime, so I had no restrictions, while I knew very well that a woman couldn’t do that. And I never met women on the ship, I worked on ships, and I worked... in German research institutes. So this... this actually happened that we had a female colleague, but maybe once. There was a soft... so she was there because a software had to be developed on site. And this was another strange thing, well, gossiping. It’s a strange part of our lives, gossip I mean. So when a man had an extramarital affair at work, this... everyone knew that, and every male was very proud to have a girlfriend. (*| *| ) But, if this happened the other way round, so when it came to light that a woman was unfaithful, then the gossip was under way, and then, well, she was a slut, so... But not in every case, because, for example, there was a secretary who openly told everyone that she had a lover. And not only one lover. The reason was that her husband drank so much that he could not perform his duty as a husband, at least that’s what she told us, and she... prevented the gossip like this; indeed, it was good tactics. She prevented people from gossiping by telling everybody that she had lovers. She even revealed who it was specifically. It was extremely embarrassing. Then there were smaller love stories, it was a research institute with a thousand people, where I worked, (name company2), and... there, well, there were smaller affairs, smaller and bigger ones. Couples swapped, round and around*| *|  there were these strange things, but the most embarrassing one was when a boss, the leader of the programmers, had a love affair with one of his subordinates. Of course, the woman was blamed in this case too. In some aspects, this was a strange relationship, I mean the man was also married and had three children, and it was known that the woman was also married and had one child; I knew the woman’s husband, he was a famous physicist, and if you have ever seen a pleasant, extremely handsome man*| *|  so he was an Adonis, he made a good impression on everyone, was intelligent, earned a lot, and he was a well-known physicist*| *|  so why did that woman have to take on that affair for the sake of her career... They were caught several times, they were kissing in the elevator and someone opened the door on them and then... even the top-management remarked that well, this, this was... this should be stopped. Once it happened that I became ill and was hospitalised, and then they arranged*| *|  they visited me, and they arranged that they would meet there. In the hospital. They arranged the date there. In order to prevent the gossip. So*| *|  this strange thing happened. |*| 6 | R: Yes, yes. She was blamed. Yes indeed. Well, she was the slut, right? So well*| *| It was a bit strange indeed. It happened that she had a child... so she became pregnant from this man, and she was ready to keep the baby, but*| *|  there was a miscarriage*| *|  but otherwise she would have given birth to the child. No doubt... you could see the reward in her career, this woman, who was not stupid, she was a mathematician, a programmer, she was progressing well in her career, receiving nice jobs. But for this? So, it was indeed a bit tasteless. |*| *| ) |*| 9 | (...) |*| 10 | R: (*| *| ) So after all, the point I wanted to make is that during my professional life, I was always conscious of the opportunities, and I felt how good it was to be a man, not to have these restrictions. So... I can travel farther, I can think more freely. (...) |*| 11 | (*| *| ) |*| 13 | R: Well, my two classmates at university whom I was talking about, who lived so freely, they were of this kind. Neither of them got married.

She taught philosophy, ethics at (name university). And she could afford to do research on monkeys, the behaviour of monkeys. She published different studies... and before, analyses of poems... because she had also studied literature, and she had participated in editing books that analysed poems. But she had a very wide range of interests; including mathematics, philosophy, and everything... she attended cuisine stuffs... So... she liked to live... she was a cheerful girl...

So getting back to the point*| *|  I graduated at the faculty of electrical engineering, where there were surprisingly many women, while at the faculty of mechanical engineering males dominated, there perhaps 10% were women. But at our faculty, there were about 500 of us in one year*| *|  at least 40 of us were girls, women. And some of them married, gave birth during meanwhile, so they lived a completely normal life. But*| *|  relatively few remained in the profession. So I for example sometimes get together with these old buddies, people from our year, from our group and there are news from here and there on who did what in their lives. So I only know about one woman in the profession, who was the development engineer in the old (name company) and now, I don’t even know how many times the company changed owners, but she is still there, working in the same place as a developer, oh, yes, and another woman, sorry, yes, who is also in the profession but more in the realm of software and programming. Our profession was like*| *|  how shall I say*| *|  we learnt how to manage and conduct production in the chemical industry, what equipment, what programs to use, so we had a wide field of learning, but many of us finished mathematics after graduation and women were eminent in this, many of whom became mathematicians but many girls from our year went into trading, economics, or anthropology or sociology, God knows why. So practically, university only served the purpose of giving a good intellectual foundation and not as a profession. |*| 4 | R: Yes, for the men, more, indeed. So, there were many men who actually went to work in factories and companies*| *|  err*| *| *|  in general*| *|  I can tell you that not many women worked where I worked. Except for one place, the (name company2), where*| *|  there was a lot of field work, there, interestingly enough, there were women, that is, those women who*| *|  so, when you search for natural resources, then you need to install these equipments*| *|  err*| *|  and you immediately need to evaluate the results. So among these colleagues who did this, there were women, but more particularly the women were working on the software, in programming, while we boys developed the hardware, and in this field there were exclusively men. Now, our relationship with the big Soviet Union, which was our largest market*| *|  and these equipments we made and which served the purpose of geophysical research were installed on boats most of the time. This was really cool to get on one of these Soviet, research boats; we had great fun there*| *|  and one sometimes wondered*| *|  women working here? Unfathomable! There was continuous round the clock work there*| *|  we lived and ate and drank with the seamen there, who were in fact geophysicists themselves. Mmm*| *|  Although their style was different from what you would imagine a seaman to have*| *|  I tried to tell a few Hungarian jokes, well slightly obscene jokes, and then*| *| *|  (*| *| ) Now, getting back to the point; in the ‘80s, I quickly searched, when the political climate thawed a bit, and it was possible to have your own private business next to your main job, I was among the first ones, first it was a small enterprise (gazdas*| á*| gi munkak*| ö*| z*| ö*| ss*| é*| g), then a cooperative (kissz*| ö*| vetkezet), and then a limited liability company, which I have since*| *|  And*| *|  this*| *|  involved a lot of travelling in the countryside, seeing other companies*| *|  and women*| *|  I only met women during my work in labs. That is, women evaluated the results, but among my partners, in factories, there were only men. And this somehow became so usual*| *|  so I took it as natural that*| *|  I don’t even know where I could meet*| *|  And then around my second job, when I could become fully independent, that is, in 1985, when I had so much work in my company that I could leave behind my last state job, where in fact there were women working there, so*| *|  I worked at (name company3) between ’80 and ’85 and there were many women there but they too worked mostly in the assembly shop, measuring devices, which was pronouncedly a “clean” job. So this is where I felt that women by default do not go into such jobs which are quote-unquote “dirty.” That is, where they need to touch dirty things. This was seemingly in contrast with the fact that most of the chemists were women. Er*| *|  that is, lab work. But this is too*| *|  err*| *|   |*| *|  |*| 6 | R: Clean*| *|  yes indeed. So some kind of cleanness, the idea of some kind of ancient purity is connected to women in my mind. |*| 7 | (*| *| ) |*| 8 | R: (*| *| ) So what I found strange is that men’s role appeared in work as well*| *|  that is, men were the ones who did the development work, who took jobs for which they needed to travel, so the work that had higher prestige went to the men. Work with lower prestige, except software because that also came to be a high prestige job*| *|  but even there men were the majority, but there, there were at least as many, or not as many but about 40% of those working there were women. So women were more visible there, which was also relatively speaking a high prestige job. |*| *|  I am not sure how much you see this, but has it changed since? That is, I believe that software has become very high prestige. |*| 10 | R: Yes, but that field too has been taken over by men by now. Well-known software professionals are men. |*| *|  most of the journalists or political scientists graduated as economists, and there are any women in marketing or company management as well. Now, where I see female roles very strong and pronounced is marketing and sales; so for example when various companies call me to sell something, it is only women who call me. Hardly ever men. So there is this charming woman voice which you cannot turn down, “Mr. (name interviewee), let me call you just (first name of interviewee)” and then she would like to sell something, whatever, like cleaning products*| *|  |*| 13 | (*| *| ) |*| 14 | R: (*| *| )*| *|  among my emails, about 90% of my emails are market-related, various news-letters and the majority of those who sign them are women. I am not prepared to give an explanation for this, unless to argue, but this is a silly opinion, that perhaps sexuality plays a role here, I mean that when a product is being sold via a pretty women in a commercial, then this product will be liked more*| *|  even among women. Unless they are selling some kind of male product, then it is a macho man shaving*| *|  but very conspicuous that there are no female comedians. There are more and more female writers but female comedians*| *|  I know women who have good sense of humour, like (name actress1), who can improvise well, has good comments, but when I watch stand up comedians, sometimes I have great fun with that*| *|  there are very few women.

And he didn’t get involved in this work enough. So, he never took a second or third job, he could not do that. He just sat down at his desk and worked on his papers, did his research, and he read a lot, but he could not*| *| *|  he was a different type of person. He would rather do household stuff in his free time, he did his work at his workplace, but even there*| *|  he didn’t*| *|  he didn’t strive to get ahead too much. Mmm*| *|  So he had a different personality. |*| *|  the division of work at home, I guess it is hard to tell, but more or less, in what proportion did you share the work at home? |*| 4 | R: My husband had a big heart, and he was always very willing to do anything, so he often surprised me when I got home and he was waiting for me with some kind of meal he had made. And he always had surprises like this. He paid attention at birthdays and name-days, he used to buy the first violet to all the women. Or the first lily of the valley. He had these skills, and as a result, we got along very well. We didn’t have big arguments, no, he let me move ahead. He helped me from the background*| *|  but*| *| 6 | R: And so we lived like this, we had a nice life; we were married for more than twenty years, till he died, so we had no big issues. Somehow, we learnt how to live with each other in harmony. I accepted his skills, what he could do. And I relied on this to get strength and motivation, that I could freely, freely realise my ideas. So he let me go on, he let me, he didn’t pull me back by saying “you won’t make it anyways” or “why are you doing this” or things like this. No, he didn’t say this. He rather said: “Give it a shot.” This was his approach. So, this worked well like this. |*| 7 | (*| *| ) |*| 8 | R: I cannot really add anything new. Perhaps only that not all women can*| *|  not all women can achieve results. Women should also be taught at school to live more consciously. There are many women who get married only to be kept and perhaps to stay at home giving birth to one or two children and they cannot show anything to society and they don’t do anything. So women should be taught to become more useful members of society because by this their life would become richer too. Many women are lost like this. |*| 9 | (*| *| ) |*| 11 | R: Well, for me*| *| 13 | R: I was 28 years old. |*| *|  |*| 15 | R: Yes, when we got married, then I didn’t have a particular desire to*| *|  so I did not have the instincts to give birth, but there was not even the possibility because he already had three children. So having the three children, we discussed that we won’t make an effort to have a fourth one, because we would rather raise the three children. And I was OK with this and I agreed because I didn’t have these motherly instincts. So until today I do not regret that I didn’t give birth. |*| 16 | (*| *| ) |*| 17 | R: (*| *| ) And I didn’t want to accept that I am a “kept women,” that is, that I live on my partner’s salary, or I didn’t want to accept to be treated as an inferior because I earned less. I wanted to be allowed to have my own salary too. So I never wanted such things and that’s why I didn’t even find one who*| *|  whom I would have*| *|  whom I wanted to choose in fact. I didn’t want to be chosen. (laughs) Unfortunately, this is not typical of a woman, but*| *|  (laughs) |*| 18 | (*| *| ) |*| 19 | R: (*| *| ) I don’t socialise much, I don’t have many friends, male or female. I don’t have the wish to sit with other 60-70 year-olds and chat about the family; I don’t have time for this. And here is the shop; I come down to the shop at 8 in the morning and leave it at 8 in the evening, and then I am happy to relax a bit because all day there is some tension, mentally and physically too. I always need to change back and forth between languages, I need to talk to one customer in Italian, the other one in English, then the third one is Spanish and I need to change their Forint to Euros, with the help of the computer. So during the whole day I get exhausted both mentally and physically, and as a result I feel much better in the evening to stay alone; I don’t miss people, I rather relax. This is what gives me energy, more so than going out. I have been, till my husband, my husband died in ’92, for a long time I have been travelling throughout the country*| *| 20 | (*| *| ) |*| 21 | R: (*| *| ) I didn’t have a female friend like this in my youth because I joined one group one day, and another the other day, so I didn’t have one*| *|  and somehow with girls I couldn’t get along that well, with boys much better. Boys, they treated me as a good friend, a buddy, they appreciated me as a friend, and we could hang out and joke around together, do sports together. I preferred doing boyish things, not partying. That’s why I didn’t have female friends, and I don’t have one till this very day, somebody who*| *| *|  I visited her in (name country2), and when I travelled around, she loves to travel too, then she came along now and then for a few weeks, this is what our relationship is like.

And I thought that perhaps in a unit in the countryside in (name village) it is better, there are more opportunities. I actually started to work there in the countryside; only it was very exhausting, every day we took a bus there, to that unit of the telephone factory, and I had to get up at half past four every morning and I got home at eight in the evening. I did this for a few years, I was getting ahead at work, was promoted, and at the end I was getting the highest dispatcher salary, but I could not have got into a higher position there, because there were these assembly units there, where they put together the parts and these assembly shops, and I worked there as a dispatcher but all of them were headed by a man. So the opportunities were already*| *|  I used all the possible opportunities there as a woman. Now, this whole thing*| *|  |*| 5 | R: As a woman I could not have got any higher. But there was another factor that contributed to this change in my life; the children were growing fast and more and more money was needed. Now there was this opportunity that in the house where I lived, the local council, it was a council at the time, asked people to rent or perhaps buy the places which were not in use in their buildings if they wanted, for any kind of use, such as small shops, enterprises, whatever*| *|  and I grabbed the opportunity telling my husband that I would leave the telephone factory and would stay at home and do such work, I would look for such work which I could do at home because then I can also run the household, you needed to cook daily, care for the kids, and that I would look for such, so that I could also earn well, let’s try this, I was telling him, that I would stay at home and we rent this place and I open a sewing shop or whatever, like getting into trade or any kind of job that I could do as a woman. |*| 6 | (*| *| ) |*| *|  when you had to leave at 5 AM I think*| *|  |*| 8 | R: We had to be at the bus stop at 4:30 AM*| *|  |*| 10 | R: Yes, because we worked till around 5 or 6 PM and the travel took about an hour. They took us to (name village). And in (name city) at a bus stop*| *|  The telephone company had its own bus but it was a shabby old bus, so I could not really do it any longer because of my health, the bus shook me so badly. And in fact that made me exhausted. |*| *|  |*| 14 | R: As a woman, for me this was a big problem every month, travelling on the bus. |*| 16 | R: So I could not do this because of my health. |*| *|  |*| 18 | R: They were not good buses, but very very old ones. You could not sit on the wheel; I would rather stand because they shook you so badly. And this was very difficult for me as a woman. |*| 19 | (*| *| ) |*| *| ) Why was it impossible for a woman to get into leadership position there? |*| 21 | R: Well, this was impossible because this was a unit in the countryside and all the leaders were men. Now, I got the highest possible salary as a dispatcher and I did not have the skills either*| *|  |*| *| ? |*| 23 | R: I did not have the qualification to head an assembly shop. OK, I did a course to be qualified as an electrical mechanic, so I did well as a dispatcher, but to be a leader*| *| *|  a lot of men who worked in the workshops, there were locksmiths, screw-mechanics, screw-makers, and machines on which only men worked*| *|  And, there, at that time, this was not a usually thing, I didn’t even think that I could get into higher position there. At that time the situation was such that the relationship between men and women was not so open, so that they would accept a woman. And I didn’t*| *|  what I felt was that*| *|  I didn’t think of becoming the head of the assembly shop. I didn’t feel that I would have the skills, or the call for this. I rather chose to stay at home, because the family was growing at home and we needed more money and the salary I got was not enough. Because*| *|  we wished to have more*| *|  and I felt I would decide to stay at home and I would go to a completely new direction beginning from zero.

Well, we succeeded in this experiment, and in fact, here the fact that I am a woman was an advantage, because after a while*| *|  the sewing and the trade, we opened an embroidery shop, it contributed*| *|  the fact that I am a woman helped me manage the shop better.

I influence people in a different way though; I do not dominate or encroach upon somebody, rather, I try to influence them in a way that they realise that what I say is better, my idea, so that he or she would imagine and identify with my idea. So I act consciously the way I do. Also in the shop I have developed a very good client relationship because for long*| *|  for decades, since the first moment of the shop, customers have been coming back and this is how this shop survives even today. They love to pop in, we talk a bit; there are customers that have been coming back for 35 years by now. |*| 3 | (*| *| ) |*| 4 | R: (*| *| ) And I love to work. If I have to work 20 hours of the 24, then I am happy to do that, I don’t get tired when I work. I had to push myself that I would use*| *|  my femininity in fact. And I feel that I succeeded to a certain extent (laughs a bit) |*| *|  |*| 6 | R: Yes, empathy, this has helped a lot. Perhaps if I had been a man, or I had been born a man, then perhaps this would not have developed in such way. And the reason is also because there was this business opportunity and also because I saw in my own environment too how many arguments and problems come from the fact that there are two people and after five sentences, they start arguing. I developed it consciously that I would not do this way; so perhaps if I had been a man, then my life would have been different. |*| *|  |*| 8 | R: Yes, this has happened, but when I ask a worker to come, then I study the work that he needs to do beforehand (*| *| ) So one needs to do things in a way that one is not tricked. A woman unfortunately*| *|  a woman needs to conform to the other person, to the other person’s skills, so for example, when you deal with a roofer, or painter, you need to research their trade a little bit, so for example when there was a painter and I didn’t know why he used that particular type of paint, then I asked somebody what the difference was between the paints, so the painter didn’t*| *|  |*| 10 | R: Yes, I had a look, and they could not really trick me. If I had ever had this in my life, then I told that worker that I was very sorry but he could not continue the work. So I was very firm. But me too, I did everything we agreed on, everything I had promised, I did everything according to how we agreed. |*| 11 | (*| *| ) |*| 13 | R: Yes, and they notice when one can say a firm yes or no*| *| *|  to shine around that you are in a good mood, that you are not tired, or tense. You need to be upbeat when you receive the customers. You always need to smile at them; that will not cost you anything, to smile back at somebody. And I could use these skills in the shop. In the shop I had to take the other person’s perspective indeed. |*| 14 | (*| *| ) |*| 15 | R: (*| *| ) I learnt how to sew. It’s true, all my life, when I got married, I told my husband: “I cannot even sew a button on a shirt” (laughs) And*| *|  |*| 17 | R: (laughs) He*| *|  he had the skills, because his parents were tailors, his parents had a big tailor shop. It was one of the most famous tailor shops in (name city) before the war, and he had learnt the trade from his parents, making clothes both for women and men. He learnt this besides the university. Yes, he finished*| *|  university. |*| 21 | R: He did, he showed me how to do it. I am a very hard-working type, I learnt it, so in half a year I became an expert and I had so much work that I had to work 20 hours a day. What’s more, it also happened that one or two nights during the week I stayed up all night; and I earned a lot with this.  |*| 22 | (*| *| ) |*| 23 | R: I do*| *|  I*| *|  I am happy with this, am happy that it happened like this; this was partly luck, and partly the fact that I looked for opportunities, such as what kind of work I could do, because a woman cannot do just any kind of work. I cannot be a carpenter, or I cannot do heavy physical labour, I had to pick something that a woman could do. So here, in fact*| *|  I used my femininity. |

I remember when we finished our University Entrance exams and the results came out*| *|  anyway it so happened that I did not get the grades I wanted in order to go to the School of my fist choice. |*| 4 | R: It was Psychology. Although I was also interested in Sociology, and I did get into Sociology in [name of city] and then I transferred here, but I was shocked*| *|  and we discussed this with my parents because we are very close. My brother got a very bad grade and did not get into any school and ... he got a lot of fuss from my parents ... but they didn’t say anything to me. They didn’t say “why did you get this grade, try again”. In my opinion because I am the daughter. For a woman a profession such as sociology*| *|  something that is not very tangible, like becoming a plumber or an electrician or a mechanic*| *|  well it’s OK. Whereas for my brother, who had to take his exams again anyway, it was expected that he would have to study something that would lead to a [regular] job. Because once he has a family he will have to support them. ... So the fact that I am a girl made things easier. I will get a degree that will be a good cover. (...) |*| 6 | R: (...) A cover that she is educated .. and of course if I want to get a job, with some effort, I will be able to get one. But, as I see it, I was not under a lot of pressure to secure a good job after my studies. Sociology is not such a secure profession, in comparison to a plumber or an electrician let’s say. (...) |*| 8 | R: I am not in agreement with this idea. Because I like to be independent. In general, one must not depend on the man. Because you never know what may happen later on, when you have a family. You might not want to go on living with him ... and if you want to survive on your own you must have some money set aside. And also having some kind of work to occupy yourself with is very important. You can’t be closed up in a house all the time. You have to get out sometime. Even if you are taking care of the children, you still need to get out, especially if you are an active person. You want something more. This is how I see it. ... In our society, OK, most people believe that “We don’t mind if a woman does not have a secure job, because, .. anyway she will find a husband who will take care of her needs.” But, OK, my personal opinion is that a woman has to be independent. (...) |*| 10 | R: (...) Yes. My mother. She worked for years. It’s just the last couple of years she has stopped working. She was always a woman who had her own money on the side. She did not have to ask my father for money for her cosmetics or her clothes. She was independent. She didn’t hang on him*| *|   |*| 12 | R: Yes, yes. This is something I am proud of. She is very competent in everything. She raised three children, worked, in general she is very active. This makes us feel better. She is tireless. Tireless. |*| 14 | R: (...) Yes.

Age 18. We had just finished school. And we wanted to go, we had agreed to go to one of the most famous nightclubs on [name of island]. We had all dressed up immaculately [laughs]*| *|  in our company there were more boys than girls, there was only me and a friend of mine as girls. And we were waiting in line at the entrance to get in, and [the doorman] gestures to us [laughs] to go in as soon as it was our turn and as soon as the boys, which were right behind us, try to pass, he stops them with his hand. And as we were moving ahead, we turned around to see where the others were and we realized they were left behind. “He won’t let us in!” they shouted. Yes. Well. Most clubs want more women*| *|  |*| 6 | R: I don’t know. To draw in more people? E, when there are more*| *|  It’s not supposed to be so nice if more men get in. They want more women. Many boys were stopped. They weren’t allowed to enter. Yes. They always want the ratio to be more women, less men. And once they saw so many boys together with only two girls [laughs], they stopped them and let us through [laughs]. |*| *|  |*| 8 | R: Always the ration is more women and less men, not the other way around. |*| 10 | (...) |*| 11 | R: E, maybe, well apart from the fact that women are a beautiful sight [laughs], I don’t understand what the reason they do this is. Because we are all people. If we want to have fun why can’t we all go to the club together? I don't understand why they do it. What their policy is. It’s unfair. Their policy.  |*| *|  |*| 13 | R: It's men we're talking about! They may think that there should be more women to a man [laughs]. This is the simplest explanation. They think. OK. A man may be turned down by this one woman, or the other one might ignore him, but he will find a third or fourth who will be willing. |*| 15 | R: Yes, and it’s unfair. Because you are full of happiness to go out with your friends, and you want to flirt and have a drink, have fun [laughs] and when the other doesn’t let you in*| *|   |*| 17 | R: (...) No, because from my brother I have learned to be with boys regularly. I used to play ball when I was little, to fight, this and that*| *|  I don’t have a problem. And it’s nice.

An acquaintance because we often bought books from him. He had a bookstore and usually bookstores in September need some extra personnel because of the bigger demand in school stuff. And even though they had agreed with him that the boy will come and work, and everything OK, and I had gone and talked to him about my salary and work hours and such, they did not hire me in the end. Certainly, I believe it made a difference that I was a boy ...I will tell you this only, because when we, when my mother went by the store two weeks later, he had hired two girls for the same post. OK. This definitely upset me and, to tell you the truth, out of spite I did not go to that bookstore again. And I shan’t ever! |*| *|  because I have also worked in Fairs and I have seen how things work. Well, you might say this too racist or something, but in sales, unfortunately, or fortunately, when they are looking for personnel they want girls. |*| 6 | R: I don’t know why. I think the reason is strictly biological. For me. Because I have seen this thing at the Fairs where I have worked. When we had girls at the counter, of course we were very polite too, but when we had girls the sales soared. In other words, we couldn’t do it. I believe it might be the sweetness that captures the eye of the buyer. Because, to put it another way, sales girls in relation to sales boys are very sweet. The way they talk to you, the smile, it makes a big difference. It doesn’t matter, you can have the highest education, if you aren’t sweet*| *| . you can’t promote the product you want. Unfortunately. I believe it is strictly a marketing issue. |*| 7 | (...) |*| 8 | R: It has to do with the fa*| ç*| ade, the show case. Because essentially a salesperson is a show case. That is, you won’t trust*| *|  even if you don’t know in advance who will be nicer, you won’t trust a girl who is overweight and a bit untidy, in relation to a girl who is blond and tall and beautifully groomed. Definitely, you mind will go to the second girl and not the first. |*| 10 | R: Look I believe it is*| *| *|  a mate. Of course, in these cases it’s not about finding a mate, but the brain, the subconscious works like this and a man will go to the nice girl and not to the untidy one. It’s about what captures the eye and get to you, where a click happens. |*| 12 | R: Look, essentially this creates an antagonism. This is certain. Because if you go to get a job and they want a salesgirl, and then you go to the next one and it’s the same, salesgirl, salesgirl, salesgirl, then in the end you will turn around and say, OK, it will create in you a kind of social racism, unconsciously of course (*| *| ) |*| 14 | R: Of gender. (...) Think of the characteristic example of the antagonism between a beautiful girl and n overweight girl. Why do they have antagonism? Because the one creates a complex in the other. The one dominates. Maybe the overweight girl is prettier, but the girl with the good looks will dominate and be more popular. This creates a bad antagonism.  |*| 15 | (...) |

And the teacher saw that she kicked me and did not give her any penalty. Whereas if she had caught us boys fighting between us ... she would have punished us. There is a rule that “OK, let her be, she is a girl”. |*| 6 | R: It is an unwritten rule. “OK, she’s a girl, she’s unprotected, she is weak”. But the only thing that is accomplished is that girls step over boys. (...) |*| 7 | (...) |*| 9 | R: Yes, in highschool there is. I believe this absolutely.  |*| 10 | (...)  |*| 11 | R: [There is the idea] that boys are more unruly and we have to direct them with the whip. Whereas girls can’t possibly be unruly.  |*| 12 | (...)  |*| 13 | R: That girls are innocent and only care about their lessons. As long as inequality is only defined ... [for girls]. It is defined for girls but also ... And this inequality is not only about discipline. It’s also about grades. If a girl has low grades and a boy has low grades as well ... well, the boy is considered a bum. Whereas the girl is just considered weak in school, that she can’t manage, that she doesn’t have the brains. |*| 14 |   |*| 16 | R: Yes. Yes. |*| 17 | (...) |*| 19 | R: Yes, the boy not the girl. (...) Once a boy was expelled from school only for cursing. But a girl who wrote that same curse on the wall didn’t get any punishment. (...) This says a lot. This is how inequalities come about. The unruly boys and the good girls. Maybe it’s also true, I don’t know, but we shouldn’t put everything in the same mold. |*| 21 | R: If it could change. I don’t know. |*| 22 | (...) |*| 24 | R: I learned that there are certainly different standards for girls and for boys (...) for the one sex and the other. |*| 26 | R: (...) Look, my behaviour was always reactionary. Anything that I feel is unjust I will expose immediately, even if it gets me into trouble. I won’t cover up for anyone. (...) And the teacher during that incident told my mother that “he’s OK, he didn’t turn around to hit the girl back, and for this reason I gave him the top grade”. (...) It was as if she was saying “OK, he was a fool and for this reason I reward him with the top grade”. I would have preferred to get a bad grade rather than be given a good grade for being a fool.

I think the most important thing, which I also experience daily, is the decision whether or not I will go on with my studies and until where does this reach, until where should I progress with my studies. This is I think the most important question. |*| 2 | (...) |*| 3 | R: Em. It has to do with the agreements one is forced to make sometimes that involve things of yourself you must leave behind in order to do something you really want. In other words, I am now 26 years old and I still live with my mother because I am still studying and I don’t have a regular full-time job that would allow me to support a place of my own. So, I have compromised to go on living with my mother but at the same time go on studying. You can’t do both at the same time. Unfortunately. |*| 4 | (...) |*| 5 | R: On the other hand, there was always this \""when are you going to get married, when are you going to make decisions, get settled\"". And also, “at some point you have to put yourself together, find a regular job and open a house like every proper woman does”. |*| 6 | R: And also, “you have to learn how to cook since you will be married one of these days and you have to learn to clean and take on the responsibilities of the home, since you are a woman” and this becomes a little bit like an internal war in our household. It’s that “yes, go on, but until where, and then who will have you, who will want you if you are always going further. It is difficult for a woman to find a man at her own level to be able to keep her. Or, if you go on working endless hours how will you be able to have a family?” |*| 8 | R: Yes, these are things that are heard more generally in the house. On the other hand, in our household we have learned that women can manage on the own, because we were left on our own. |*| 9 | R: So, this was a kind of alibi for me, that there doesn’t have to be a man around to support a home. Women can do it on their own. |*| 10 | (...) |*| 11 | R: [Without the father who died] very early. Very early in their maried life. |*| 12 | (...) |*| 14 | R: It means that I want to go on with my life whatever that may entail. Whether I find a partner or not, I will have my own base and my own opportunities, financially, work-wise, home-wise. |*| 15 | (...) |*| 16 | R: (...) It is true that until now men seldom tolerate if you work more hours than they do. |*| 17 |   |*| 18 | R: Even though I make much less money than any of the partners I had up until now, they rarely tolerated that I have a very tight work-schedule, with work and studying, and different courses and other things that I want to do. Usually they react against this.  |*| 19 | (...) |*| 20 | R: (...) That you don’t care about the relationship, that you place work above them. That, OK you will go on with your studies but we can’t and then how are we going to have a family. It’s best if you work a few hours and then come home and take care of the kids and the household. |*| 23 | R: She is very positive about the fact that I want to go on with my studies and she supports me a lot in this decision, but often she brings up questions and sometimes even conflicts about ‘how far this will go’. In other words, “you are going deeper and deeper into this [your studies] and want more and more and where will this lead? When will you have your own family? |*| 24 | (...) |*| 26 | R: I think the first major decision was about what I wanted to study. I did not want to become a teacher. In the sense that my mother wanted. To have a job with set hours and then be able to care for your family. I think the most important decision I made was to go against this expectation and to study social sciences. It was the first decision I made on my own. |*| 27 | (...) |"

About professional contexts, I believe women have easier access to services, whether private or public. This has to do with politeness.

I had gone to the National Bank for some work for the Mental Health Society I was working for, together with the president of the Society who is the one responsible to sign all society documents. We were waiting in line together. When our turn came, he went forward with a certain air, of the man who says, “I have come to take care of business”. And they did not serve him. Whereas when I approached, service was immediate and I managed to do everything we wanted, and even more. It was a matter of politeness and of approaching people with kindness and not haughtiness or titles. |*| 5 | (...) |*| 6 | R: (...) Men believe that with the title of President or because they assume, as men, to know better, they will get things done, and often they do not use the right approach with people.

A colleague of mine, twice my age, but much less experienced on the job, wanted to play director with me, even though we had the same position. And this was a problem. |*| 13 | (...) |*| 14 | R: (...) He tried to take my work and present it as his. This was particularly annoying to me. First of all because he had not done the work. And secondly, because he did not know how to do the work on his own. He took the end result and presented it as his own work. |*| 15 | (...) |*| 16 | R: (...) This often made me feel exposed.

This, that the man must appear to make the final decisions still holds. Even though the women of my generation, but also of the older generation, believe they are the ones who actually make the decisions, they think we must use this female characteristic, to make it seem as if he is the one who decides. |*| 7 | (...) |*| 8 | R: This is a bit tragic I think. |*| 9 | (...) |*| 10 | R: I believe all ideas should be on the table, and the one which is best should be chosen, regardless of who proposes it.

This necessarily changes the terms of cohabitation. Of course not in all families. I know families where the husband still comes home and expects to find food on the table. I find this too tragic. |*| 15 | (...) |*| 16 | R: (...) But, I think that this change in cohabitation has brought other changes in the family. It has in fact made them more dependent on the couples’ parents. Grandparents play a very important role in the family, even if they no longer live with the family. They appear to be further outside the family but, at least in the couples I know, they at the same time play a very important role in the family and take on the burdens of the younger generation. |*| 18 | R: They take care of the children, they cook, they pay the bills. |*| 19 | (...) |*| 20 | R: Even though they are not inside the house any longer, in the traditional sense, their roles are even stronger now. |

I am an animator-psychologist and I work in a museum for children.

(...) |*| 3 | (...) |*| 4 | R: (...) Being a man made a difference because in this line of work there are many women but only a few men. Like with kindergarten teachers. But children need a male role model and it was helpful for me professionally that I chose to do something that others don't do because of the stereotypes that exist. Usually men are not kindergarten teachers, even though it is very good for children to see a man doing this. It is a job that is thought to be women's work, because women are closer to motherhood. According to the stereotypes. So, in my work I was glad to find an environment that was more liberal and positive for my relationship to children. |*| 5 | (...) |*| 8 | R: (...) My choices were related to psychology. But there are two sides always, not to idealize things. I will talk about both the good and the bad side. The good side is that I did what I wanted. I tried a more artistic profession that combines education, art, psychology, something more avant-garde. But I was aware that I am going for something with less money and that it is a job where you will encounter resistance from the family who say, where are you going, this is not common, why are you doing this, working with children, will you always be able to work with children even when you are fifty or sixty, this is something that clowns do. |*| 10 | R: A person in my family. My father said, you are a psychologist and you will be working with children until you are fifty? As if working with children is just a phase, a training you have do like a doctor, and then you will join the grownups. I see many stereotypes like this from the older generation who had survival problems and had not looked into different things. I can't even approach this generation, I feel a chasm with older people. Needs have changed. They talk about the needs of their society but now needs are more multiple and they can't realize this. |

I don't go into the topic because it seems strange to them, how can you be working with children. (...) |*| 2 | (...) |*| 3 | R: These limits are stated in our conversations. He has said that he believes in the traditional role of the genders, that is, a man must do one, two, three things, and the woman must also do one, two, three things. To which I agree to some extent, but not to the extent that he believes. I mean it's nice to have some rules because otherwise we won't know who we are anymore, but I just feel when I discuss with him, that whatever he sees as must or... mustn't is more... (...) |*| 5 | R: Now that I think about it more I believe that in my relationship to my parents the problem with my professional career is not so much in relation to gender, to the fact that I am a man, but in relation to social status. It is more with my friends and in my social relations more generally that this work I do with children is considered problematic for a man. Working in kindergarten, in our every day reality we find more women than men. |*| 7 | R: My teacher was a positive influence.

For example, I am doing my psychology training in a nursery school, where I was looking after a kid which had behavioral problems, hyperactivity. And there was the teacher who did theatrical play who had dressed the little boys as flowers. They were four years old. And a mother comes in crying, and saying, how dare you do this thing, how dare you make my child into a flower, what if his father sees him, are you serious, make him into the sun, right now, not a flower. This made an incredible impression on me, and we are talking now about a four-year old child. |*| 3 | (...) |*| 4 | R: What happened. The teacher was forced, in order to avoid a fuss, this was a private school, she couldn't discuss this any further with the mother, to tell her this is not so, but, in order to appease the mother she had to assuage her anxiety which was so great and would need several months' work to go away. The other thing that has happened to me was with a group. I had organized an activity of theatrical play for children in [name of neighborhood], and there we had open meetings so new people could learn about and come to the group. The parents could watch the meetings, could watch me interact with the children, it was an open session so they could enroll their child. During the conversation afterwards I saw a mother who was very excited, she liked it, and I could see this, she was different before and after the session. I asked her, will you enroll your child in the theatrical play workshop? Oh, no, she said, I don't believe this is right for little boys, I will take my son to karate. I told her, the one doesn't exclude the other. You can take him to karate and to theatrical playing as well. I don't understand why there has to be this attitude that little girls go to theatrical playing activities and little boys to karate. Both can do both at the same time. Little girls can do karate and theatre, and little boys can do karate and theatre. |*| 5 | (...) |*| 6 | R: Angry, I was very angry, and I expressed it. I told her, what you are saying is not correct. It seems to me it takes us back a long way. The identity of your child is not at risk to become a homosexual and all that, from the theatre. That is, this is the worry. If something like that happens it won't be from the theatre, it can happen through any other aspect of life. That is, it is not the knife's fault if we kill someone, what is at fault is something behind the knife. The knife is just a tool, it can help us cut things. Just that. But I find this in front of me all the time. I think about this thing that happened to me a lot, both with regards to the kindergarten and with regards to the theatrical play group. |*| 8 | R: No, I have no doubts whatsoever. I am totally clear about this. Because someone who has an education has seen different things, has seen theatre, martial arts, movement, everything. I have not a shroud of doubt. |*| 10 | R: They do*| *|  possibly. Because of the labeling in this particular space I believe. OK, it would help if I had a deeper voice, if I resembled an experienced mainstream actor. I don't know. [Laughs]. Look... I don't even know myself, yes, sometimes some people think so stereotypically that I myself can't comprehend them. |

Of course I was quite spoilt as an only child, I had special attention, especially since I had some health problems, I was a little bit sickly. But I left home at an early age and started working, I wanted to be independent, and I worked, I did things on my own, to prove myself, to prove I could manage on my own.

What’s going to happen, what am I going to do, I am a woman, I have to get married, I have to have a child, and you know, I got very stuck on this, even though it had never appeared in my life before.

I might try it once but, I have thought quite a bit about it, and I don’t want to develop this mania that I must absolutely have a child and drive myself crazy, because I do see this happening to people around me, there is a tremendous anxiety about having a child under any circumstances, with many IVFs and this and that, and you get into an overwhelming and consuming state in order to have a child at any cost, financial or psychic. (...) |*| 15 | (...) |*| 17 | R: I connect it to .. I think that it mostly has to do with an internal fear of mine that I don’t want to be left alone. Of course this in only in our minds I think, this issue of loneliness and growing old alone, but there often is this intense fear around this. One of the things is that my father got sick and died of cancer very suddenly. |*| 19 | R: We lost him within just four months and there I saw, I experienced very revealingly what it means to have someone of your own next to, or not to. You know, this is a fear that is inside and that’s where I think my change comes from. Perhaps it’s also a bit egotistical, perhaps this also hides some egotism. Because all of a sudden we have started having these thoughts, that we will get older and be alone and should have someone around, in the sense of a dedicated person, not just a friend, because I have many friends but it’s not the same.  |*| 21 | R: I really experienced with my parents that the emotional relationship between us was much more than what I can have with my friends.

It was hard and I was unemployed and couldn’t find work for over a year. (*| *| ) So I decided to change completely, completely. I had to. And I went to a job that is completely different. In publishing. Specifically in a bookstore. As you can understand, suddenly at this age I had to deal with a new space, completely new, other colleagues, other codes, everything was completely different. Going to my work I encountered as a woman, something I saw very clearly there for the first time, the fact that men in the specific area of work do not accept women’s opinions. I also observed this with other women colleagues who have this problem, this problem that when women, either higher up in the hierarchy, or from the Administration, that they [men] have a problem when women tell them what to do, and you can see terrible antagonism, which they don’t acknowledge either! |*| 5 | (...) |*| 6 | R: (...) They [men] have a problem obeying someone higher up; even the woman is their senior. They will either question, if not in front of them, then in the back, behind the curtains, or they will find ways to devaluate the role. Either because they feel they lack something, because that’s where it starts I think. I had to face it too. |*| 7 | (...) |*| 8 | R: (...) For example, to say your opinion on something and the other one doesn’t listen. |*| 9 | (...) |*| 11 | (...) |*| 12 | R: (...) It is clearly a matter of gender.

I for instance, because I did not have previous experience, just simply said my opinion. Of course I have been there a year now and I have done really well, everyone says so. Still I see that my boss at the bookstore did that with me too. After a few times I said, ‘OK let it go’. OK, I won’t spend all my time on this. He may well have personal problems as well. But I have had a couple of conflicts. I have had really serious conflicts on these matters. OK, he understood afterwards. Now of course things are different because we have a personal relationship and when you get to the point where you have a personal relationship things change. He may accept you on the job because of the personal relationship. (...) |*| 15 | (...) |*| 16 | R: (...) This person’s behaviour also changes when he comes across a girl who is younger and cuter. He would change his attitude. But when you are more serious and distanced and want to be totally*| *|  not to play the kitten basically or flirt, well there he has a problem. (...) |

I felt endlessly free, I had no pressure from my family, neither my father nor my mother, in spite of the bad relationship I had with my father, whereas my sister was deadly oppressed in a way of being that in essence has plagued her for life. Because she has been in therapy for the last x number of years and they have told her that all her problems with her current husband have their roots in that period of her life. She went to the Nun’s School in [name city]. The oppression was unbelievable. On a daily basis. And the reading requirements too. Whereas I went to [name school] that was a good school, but where we had a lot of free time, and no control or anything. OK, they were after us for our long hair. But this was of no importance. But in my family I had no pressure in spite of the fact that because of adolescence and of the turbulent times I was the one who created all the problems at home, and I was at odds with my father. |*| 3 | (...) |*| 4 | R: For political matters.

But they came home later because they had three hours of French every day and there was a puritanical .. There were regular nuns there. The environment was terribly puritanical. In high school, they checked the students when they entered and left if they have plucked their eyebrows, or painted their nails, or they checked under their skirts if they shaved their legs. Terrible things for a young girl. |*| 7 | (...) |*| 8 | R: My sister suffered. She had a little affair and my parents were really awful to her, they locked her inside, tore up her letters and read her diary. It was like a rape of her personality, this thing. And I believe she closed up and wilted after this. I remember she was a young girl like all the rest. Ready to blossom and then in high school she got washed out. And since then she was always very timid and she underplayed her female side. I can’t quite understand what happened. And the husband she married in effect was like a substitute of my father. She never fell in love. Something she discovered thirty years later. (...) |*| 9 | (...) |*| 10 | R: (...) When she was*| *|  she was flirting she didn’t have an affair, when she was 14, with a young boy her age in [name place] and I remember my father came and I didn’t understand what he was trying to tell me. He grabbed me very angrily and said you have to protect your sister because if you don’t they will call you a cuckold and they will call me a cuckold as well. I did not know what cuckold meant. I asked my mother. Of course my mother did not believe all this but what could she do, she had to excuse him. (...) |*| 12 | R: I don’t remember. I was taken aback and scared by what he was saying. I couldn’t understand what this entire thing that fell on my head was. Oh, and I think I asked him, will something happen to my sister? I don’t remember what he answered. I had three years difference from my sister. I was 11 at the time, you see? My sister was 14 and I was 11. What could I possibly understand? |*| 13 | (...) |*| 15 | R: Well, I did not take on this role my parents wanted to give me. For anything in the world. First of all my sister was older. I loved her and we were friends, if she needed me to protect her I would do it. But I would not get between her and a boy. Love, you see, seemed to me to have nothing to do with danger. If she were in danger from someone I would defend her. But not from someone who liked her and whom she liked as well. |*| 17 | R: Good question. No. Because I left. At 14 I opened the door and left. And I left my poor sister behind. Whereas I should have defended her. I should have defended her; I have many guilt feelings because of this. I left her at their mercy, truly. OK. The situation was like that. I was younger and I was a boy. I had different friends. I was into politics. She wasn’t. We got lost to each other. My sister never rebelled. Ever. Only now. She is making her revolution now at 54. |

For me it was a tendonitis of the Achilles muscle 15 years ago, in 1995. I was with crutches for about a year and a half. Because the muscle didn’t heal properly, I didn’t have physiotherapy when I needed it and this left me half invalid. (*| *| ) It started from a stupid situation. From tiredness that I didn’t take into account. I was walking for endless hours. I helped a woman friend moving house. I didn’t pay attention and then .. you see I was very athletic and I thought that a body that exercises can take everything. But this was a good lesson that I needed to take better care.

I repaid some of my obligations, which I too had accepted, but which were also predetermined by my sister’s husband’s family, by his parents and older brother. That I would provide a home for her.

And, I have an example of a friend of mine, who left home before completing Law School to become a monk at Mount Athos. Because he did not feel he could give his sister a dowry. Same thing with him.

I can’t underestimate the fact that men and women, except for their social codification also have different sex organs, but nevertheless, I believe that as a function, as a psychological, even biological, function, we have both genders inside. It’s just that our form, as male and female is different. Your behaviour though can be masculine or feminine regardless of gender.

When I went to [name of city] [to study Architecture], I became friends with a woman colleague of mine, with whom we had a two-year relationship. A good, creative relationship, that cannot be questioned on its quality or duration, but which suffered an irrevocable blow when one summer she came down to [name of home city] and was entertained by my family home as a guest, in order to finish a job we were working on. A summer job. Well, at this summer descent to [name of home city] - of course she was a girl who also had her mother, a good home, a way of managing her house - she found herself compared to, (...), well, compared to the way things were managed in my own home .. to my mother and, by extension also, my sister, who had learned how to be a good housekeeper from my mother.

For example, about how she had made herself at home, how she left her clothes lying around, such things. These were comments of my mother’s, so to speak. Which the girl was also aware of but could not adjust to, of course. Because you can’t always understand what it is that the other wants, and you are taken aback by the fact that from a guest you suddenly become a scapegoat. Very difficult things. |*| 14 | R: Exactly. Because I had not questioned yet, through acceptance of another person, our way of life. (...) |*| 16 | R: No, no. This [meaning the institution of marriage] was probably the least important. The most important was the duration of living together, the shared experiences. (...) Look, marriage is a thing where ... this emotional shift happens mostly after you get married. Marriage is like fireworks, it creates tensions. (...) But this is not something I am concerned with. What I am concerned with is that when you leave some people, the old family, behind and go on with your life with a different person, you find out that needs are not male or female but human, and then you form an affinity to this new person (...) and you recognize that [she] has her own rights.

There is one incident from the time when I was trying to get into Architecture School, which was a school of high standards. At that time we were concerned that the family’s efforts do not go to waste, both my own reading and efforts, as well as my father’s work, his money in other words. That these efforts do not go to waste but accomplish their goal. My father was not very concerned that I study something I like, but that I get on with a profession and start producing.

It was assumed that I would study to become an architect, a doctor. As a man in the house, it was clear that I would study. For my sister, they did her the favour to allow her to take exams once to become a teacher, and when she failed she was not allowed to take exams again. She started working, she married. She remained somewhat static, but she learned other things, she learned life. (...) It was completely self-evident that the one who would make something of himself  |*| 10 | R: (...)

We had debts. It was really hard grinding. It would not be possible today. Labour protection laws would prohibit using child labour but at that time it was normal to work as a child. In a way, life in a big family is rich. There were siblings and compared to a modern life that feels good. Today children have all kinds of brick-a-brac around them, we were working and we invented the games ourselves. We made cows out of cones and played all this kind of games.  |*| 2 | It took a while and the countryside changed. It was on my mind as well to get lighter work. There was an end to the lumbering and it was necessary to move out to the cities. Well, hard work continued here as well of course but in a different way. I moved to metal work and started a family. When I was a child, men’s participation in raising children and doing housework was completely different than today. Men did not interfere in taking care of the children and didn’t do housework. They were doing all the hard work and womenfolk did the housework and took care of the children. However, when I started a family, I participated in some ways in housework and took also care of the children. When my own children were born, it was in a new place. Over 500 kilometres away from the countryside. It was a different culture, one had to adapt. Children and grandchildren have been raised and nurtured in a different way than in my time.  |*| 3 | (...) |*| 5 | R: In the 70’s when the children were born there were not so many kindergartens at that time. My wife took care of the children in the home and I was working. My wife worked during the weekends and I took care of the children. That was hard work too.  |*| 6 | (..)  |*| 8 | R: There were. The roles of men and women showed up in the factory work. Women were given repetitive work. They were kind of an extension to a machine. Men did the more demanding tasks. I ended up taking a secondary occupation as a shop steward. I took care of that job for 20 years. That came with stress and challenges, arterial hypertension and all that. That was related to being a man. There were mostly men who were chosen for that role as a shop steward.  |*| 10 |   |*| 11 | R: I think it is the division of work in the household. Women are needed to take care of the kids at home. There were some women working there but as there were meetings in the evenings, it was often so that men were there and women were working in the home. They took care of the children and cooked. |*| 13 | R: Yes. Their wages were lower. They were given monotonous work beside a machine. They folded (metal) sheets. It did not require any education. This was how the work was divided where I worked. Wages were smaller. It might have been lighter work but often monotonous. Same repetitive stage over and over again.  |*| 15 | Physically thinking. I don’t know. It changed but the monotony was quite often there. (*| *| ) Many women said that it is not a problem for them, they think about what they will do at home when they get there.  |

R: It could be this trade union activity in which I participated when I was doing metal work. There were mostly men who participated at that time, like it is now as well. When I start to think about it, I had just started a family, I had small children, hard work and on the side trade union activity. I have many times thought whether it had an effect on family life. Was there enough time for kids, wife and housework? Meetings in the evening and things like that, training courses*| *|  I thought I can have an effect on issues this way and get something out of it, but in fact it demanded a lot. Was it more important than participation in normal family life and being with children? How is it reflected on... These are questions to think about afterwards, but life at that time was like that. Hard, stressful but it had to be done. I would not do it again if it was possible. It was really enfeebling. It was a male dominated activity; women were home with the kids doing household work while men participated in trade union activity. I don’t know what else to say about it.  |*| 3 | R: In fact she never objected or judged me but*| *|  I wouldn't know if she was*| *|  I guess she thought that it is part of work, influencing issues and so on. She never*| *|  I don’t remember that she had asked that I have to stop doing it. She had in a way become conscious that someone has to do this work.  |*| 5 | R: That I did it? Like I said, I don’t think that I would do it again if I could choose once more. There were of course also good moments. It felt good to participate, but I do think that since the kids are there, there should be more time to be with them. At least as I am retired now*| *|  Well, now I have hobbies but since the kids are grown up, I think it is better to have hobbies than just lie down on the coach. At that time as I had*| *|  There is the house loan, the kids are small, work and trade union activities on the side. It was difficult. Like I have said, I have hypertension as a memory of that. Luckily, I am not a drunk like many people who do that.  |*| *| ) You mentioned that it would have been nice to spent more time with the kids, did I understand correctly? |*| 7 | R: Yes, looking back I think that it took a lot of time. When you are home, you are tired. I remember that my wife said afterwards that when you came from work, you just lied on the couch with a newspaper. It felt normal but now when I think about it, she must have felt that it is wrong that.. I should have had the energy. These are the role of men and women. As my wife was home, I thought that it is right that she had cooked. When the man comes home tired and lies on the couch, that is not a good thing from the perpective of women. However, it was often like this. After a hard day, there was no energy to have hobbies or be active.  |*| 9 | R: I guess it was a necessity. We had bought an apartment and took a loan and we had to pay it back and get money. At that time*| *|  Both of us had moved from the countryside and we didn’t have a circle of acquintances who would have taken care of the kids. At that time there were no kindergartens like there are now. It was a necessity this arrangement. When I look back, I think it is crazy. There is not much time for family life. It was hard and exhausting. This is the way it was arranged. Some people are blaming us, who have been born right after the war, that we are just parasites. That we are in good positions in society and and do not think about the young people. (laughs) I don’t know. It is a history full of work and I am happy to enjoy old-age benefits. (...) |

As I am a man, I have felt it almost in an annoying way that women are great and interesting and attractive people. Five years ago I got to know a young woman, whom I found interesting and smart. We all think that someone is more interesting and smarter (than someone else). We hit it off and it is relevant to the story that I am a married man with 3 children. This woman was*| *|  We had so much to discuss that... She was half my age, so I thought it is not necessary to think that we would sleep together and start a sexual relationship even though she was an attractive young woman. It turned out that she is looking for a man. She is looking for someone double her age. I was thinking that is she looking for*| *|  Does she have a problem with her father? Nowadays there are even marriages that the man is 60 or 55 and the woman is 30. As there are such (relationships), I didn’t think it is so special.  |*| 2 | This woman invited me to her home. She lived alone and was well-off. There was something a bit strange in her home. It was beautiful, cosy but there was something so strange. The art was strange and the details - I find strange to say it when the recorder is on -  they referred to a sexual deviation. I started to think that \""does this woman want me to tell her what it is to be a man and what men actually want? Does she have sincere lesbian thoughts of her life, that she could live closer with another woman or*| *| ?\"" There was lesbian sadomasochistic art in her household. I approached the theme sensitively from my point of view and this woman expressed it by saying that a man is rarely a visually beautiful being. (laughs) I thought that that’s it. The man works but when a man is close, the eyes are closed. But the man is and works. Women are nicer to look at. This is how I came to this conclusion. She was a bit different*| *|  The atmosphere was strange. We were close, but I didn’t feel like it and I guess neither did she (talks about sex). I would not have*| *|  She expressed positive thoughts regarding nakedness but I didn’t start to... I thought she was that sort of a person, and so much younger than me, that I didn’t think about it, but she took the relationship really seriously and was looking for something in me that I had to reflect myself.  |*| 3 | Then she invited me.. She asked whether I would go with her to Lapland for a hike. From the beginning, she had paid attention to the fact that I am an experienced explorer (in terms of hiking). I accepted the invitation but I have to say that I did not want to jeopardise the atmosphere of my marriage by saying that I will go to Lapland with a young woman. That’s why we collected a group of four people. I was the reason for that. The hike went well and it was clear that we are a couple.  |*| 4 | I want to add that I have been for this long with this young, attractive woman but we had never had intercourse. She wanted us to go again (to Lapland). She wanted just the two of us to go. Well, we went there. To go to Lapland. It means going far away to another environment where both do healthy activities. You do cross-country skiing for long distances and go to sauna. |*| 5 | (*| *| ) |*| 6 | R: She told me that a quite smart man both of us know, who is much closer to her age, had made sadistic approaches on her and had annoyed her especially. This is also a familiar area of sexual behaviour for me but I think this young woman should have made the things clearer. I didn’t start to*| *| 7 | (*| *| ) |*| 8 | R: I have heard that for older men it is elegant and classy to appear with young women but as it is not real and as there is no clarity, I have ended this relationship. I hope that she would find someone who is smarter than me but I don’t think it is possible to find someone who is much smarter than me (laughs). It could not have been my problem but I was made to tell what it is to be a man. I guess she was not a virgin but I didn’t find that out.  |*| 9 | (...) |*| 10 | R: I have experienced more and more that for young women there is lack of clarity on some things. Something is strangely unclear. (...) Why I have often had to resolve this kind of things is a mystery to me. I don’t have statistical data whether men in general have to*| *|  I think that the life of some men is quite cut-and-dried. They pick up a woman, spend a night with her or are in a long marriage and are faithful for 50 years. The role of a man is easier. I have been asked strange things and put into strange situations*| *|   |*| 11 | (...) |*| 13 | (...) |*| 14 | R: It seems to me that the role of a man is easy. A grown-up Finnish man who lives an earnest life. It looks dull from the outside and easy*| *|  Going to work, drinking some booze and talking with other men on all kinds of things. Then you are married for 50 years or just live otherwise. I have experienced that men have to problematize things rarely the way I have had to. I don’t know. Maybe men don’t talk to each other. A man that I respect has told me that I have a strange way to problematize the relationship between a man and a woman, in a context where he had started to talk about men and women.  |*| 15 | (*| *| ) |*| 17 | R: Yes, it was clear that as I am an older man, I solve, explain, open, make drafts and show what it is about and solve it. For example, with my active intervention I let her to experience options in life, which I think is stupid. A person has to, even a woman has to know that it is not necessary to play that today it’s like this and tomorrow like that. (...) |"

A man*| *| After some light relationships with wo... with girls, I had a crush on a smart girl. Should I talk honestly...? We were in our twenties. I met a smart girl and then I found out that she had graduated with top grades and got top results in the matriculation exam. She is a person who manages things. One could see that. We were a couple and once she invited me to a family gathering. I guess it was the 80th birthday party of a great-uncle. I went with her. We had dated for six months. There were a lot of small kids and the kids got tired. The grown ups had their own fun. I saw my girlfriend with the kids when she committed the kids to the process and created a magical atmosphere for them. How she took care of the kids like a child psychiatric, which she was not. I was wondering what this is. When we got home that afternoon, I thought that if I want to have children, I want to have them with this girl. I had seen something like that. It was partly superficial. I proposed to marry her, we got married and got our first child. Like I had felt, she was really skilled and even the midwife asked me where do these skills come from. I told her that I don’t know. She is socially talented. I guess that as a man, I made a plan for the rest of my life. In the army it is said that if somebody asks, you have to answer. I didn’t choose my partner primarily*| *|  Maybe it was good that I didn’t have a crush on a posh blond but [I made the decision] rationally. I did*| *|  I wanted to have a mother for my childen, I made the choice and chose her.  |*| 2 | Then there was a second child and a third child. A man does not change, but a woman changes. The sexual desires, which had been great, started to diminish and she became a qualified fonctionnaire and a mother. I got a bit annoyed with that. As I don’t know how common that is, I had a bad conscience. In fact, I was thinking for a long time what this was. Am I a father? I will start raising the kids, go to the school board, to the parent-teacher association. Is that what it is like to be a father? Of course, I could leave my hobbies [to the kids], which I did later. For example nature, hiking and Central Europe. I could communicate on those issues. As a man, I did not change during these decades. I just turned sixty, so I can talk about decades. I [did not change] such a way that I would not have wanted to be with a woman as a woman, I didn’t need her post or her motherhood. There was an air of strangeness that developed. She became a good mother and a good fonctionnaire, which started to grind me. Such a thing happened that... Well, a man travels. I met a smart woman who had widowed and had two kids but she had not changed. Maybe the case was that she wanted still to be with men and my wife had a husband who was available. She had taken it as a project. I was in an affair which was great. Why am I telling you this...? This is the most common story in the world. I am telling you a story that it so common and there is nothing individual about it.  |*| 3 | (*| *| ) |*| 4 | R: Then I met a school friend. We had been together for about 2.5 hours when she asked me to go to her place and we slept together. In spite of the fact that I have a wife and a very smart girlfriend.  |*| 5 | (*| *| )  |*| 6 | R: I have thought about this. What is the status of a man in Saudi Arabia? There people have many wives. (*| *| ) I have thought about this and [came to the conclusion] that as a man it is not*| *|  I have heard that a nasty word such as status is being used, but it is not about status. The situation is such that I can honestly say that I love all these three women. They are real people, it is not about abuse or about a relationship outside marriage. I claim that all these relationships are equal. Damned. I claim that I have two very good girlfriends and a wife. I would like to clarify the situation but I don’t know how to. |*| 7 | (*| *| )  |*| 8 | R: I have been thinking that how does the life of a man continue when I turn 65 and retire. I am not so mobile anymore. I start to*| *|  Do I just sit at home on a rocking chair and watch TV from the sofa? How does the life go on  as these two women are part of my life in a rational way. (*| *| ) I don’t have so much urges to sleep with women, I just think that they are great creatures. It is more like I could stop having a sexual relationship with these two women and keep them as friends but their motive is that I keep them partly alive, as it is not easy for them to find other men. I am not trying to compose a song of praise for manhood for having these three precious and central relationships with women but it is more like a trap. I have wanted to be with these people. This is what has happened.  |*| 9 | (*| *| ) |*| 10 | R:*| *| Even though I am an old man, in my sixties, I  am expected to behave in a traditional masculine way. |*| 12 | R: Showing sexual desire. It is not necessary to analyze it more. (*| *| ) I don’t want to hurt people. I have just realised that this is the way it is. This is how it has happened, I have sought their friendship and have been succesful besides the fact that I am a man. They expect me to behave like this [talks about sex]. |*| 13 | (*| *| ) |*| 14 | R: I have become cautious as a man. As I am already this old, my desires and sexual potency will go down. (*| *| ) I can conclude that when someone is over sixty, to be a man... I guess there are less positive definitions. Condition goes down. If a man is being assessed based on his condition, potency, ability to act and do things*| *|  I have wondered whether I will just accept the role of a grandpa. A role of a bit silly grandpa. Is that what is waiting for me? I guess it is, but I don’t know how to act that role.  |*| 16 | R: I am not able to think that far. I see someone else. I don’t see myself in that role. I just see grandpas who are a bit silly and who like to spend time with their grandchildren. I guess some of them like that and I guess I will too. I cannot think that far. I cannot think further. Will it be silent walking with slippers on, picking up the newspaper in the morning and drinking coffee? Then the grandchildren will come for a visit and so on. Is that how life will be like in a while? I have worked in tasks that are related to the military and there people are prepared to die quite*| *|  Men are. People around me have commited suicide and avoided being grandpas. I have heard that it is a sign of depression if one starts to think how to do it and how much it hurts people around you. I have realised that it would hurt them so much that I cannot do it. I have thought that as I have known soldiers who are*| *|  whose profession is related to dying*| *|  I have thought that I could die elegantly when I am under seventy. I don’t find my inner grandpa.   |*| 17 | (*| *| ) |*| 19 | R: Yes. I have been expected to solve other people’s problems and I have solved them. I have been helping lonely, smart women to feel that they have a life. I have felt it a bit... It has not been unpleasant for me but that is about to end. One cannot have that role for much after, after turning sixty. It will end. The condition will drop. I have seen that in people around me. Smart people who have lived a healthy life are in a hospital all of a sudden. I don’t understand this critical period and how will it all turn out but let’s see.  (...) |*| 20 |   |

I went there and am really happy that I did. It was quite a positive experience. I believe I could have joined, even if it would not have been as obligatory as it is in practice. However, I am sure that the fact that I am a man had an impact on the issue, as men tend to join the service in Finland. I think it is quite good (that men do it). I am quite sure that if I had decided to do the civil service instead of the military service or if I had dropped out, I am sure that I would have heard comments about it afterwards. I think it is wrong that you can make a comment on an issue like that, as it can be someone’s own free choice. However, it is clear that if 95 per cent of your male friends join the military service, your father has completed it, your brother has completed it, it is clear that you also think of joining. At the end, I am really happy that I did it, because it was a good experience. However, if I had omitted the military service or if I had dropped out and chosen something else, I think even today it could have been considered as untypical behaviour for a man. People might think that it is not the way a man is supposed to behave. I think that a great part of those who join the military service want to at least try it, because men tend to complete it in Finland. I think it is part of the role model offered for men. It is being argued that the military service turns boys into men. I believe it does in a way. You learn to behave there, to lead and to be in a group. I think the military service is a masculine thing but in a good sense. However, in my life I have met men who think it is not a masculine thing to go there. On the contrary, they think that if you wanna go, you can go. According to them, gender is not an issue there but my opinion is that it is. Equally, there are many women who would like to try but do not have the courage, as they think the atmosphere there is very chauvinist, as it actually is - as it is a male community. It is clear the atmosphere is like that. For women that must be even harder, double the time harder. |*| 2 | (...) |*| 3 | R: I believe I learned many things in the military service. Things like tolerance to discipline and hunger. I made a lot of friends, we did a lot of sports and outdoors excercise etc. |*| 4 | (...) |*| 5 | R: In that context, you behave the way the context requires. If you do not tell chauvinist jokes, you are not a man and if you do not... There were people who did not like guns, who did not like to fight. They were not considered as men, as they did not like guns and as they did not behave according to a certain role model. |*| 6 | (...) |*| 7 | R: In the military service, where men predominate, certain norms are being created. You have to behave according to the norms and if you don’t you are considered as a gay or a girl. I think it is wrong in a way. Those who cannot fake that model or who are not like that have to suffer. In the military service, if someone was gay, if people knew someone was gay, it was really bad for him. Or if you were a woman, you had to stand (many things). |*| 8 | (...) |*| 9 | R: What kind of role models, is that what you asked? I guess such as a Finnish man does not feel agony, a Finnish man does not talk about anything, a Finnish man does what he is told to do and*| *|  Such models (of behaviour) that are not being offered so much anywhere else anymore. It is very interesting as a society otherwise... For example, people whom I have got to know at the university, other men, are very different. In the tabloids, the men are advised to wash the dishes, wash the clothes and take care of the kids when the wife goes to a bar or when the wife goes thaiboxing. They are also advised to do things for the woman and talk about their emotions. A soft model is being given (for men). In the military service, the role model offered is completely the opposite. There you have to be tough. If you are not tough, you have to prove that you are. The atmosphere is traditional there, tough, harsh male culture. If you cannot adapt to that, it would have been much tougher for sure. |*| 10 | (...) |

We have a long time ago passed the turn of the 21st century and I see that the atmosphere in Finland nowadays and surely elsewhere in Nordic countries (I guess elsewhere in Western countries as well, I believe), is such that gender roles have been changing radically. In general, the role of men and women is changing. Earlier a man brought money to home and said that this is the way it is, and that is the way it has been. There has not been much negotiation. Women have been waiting there beside a stove. Perhaps, at least in my opinion, something has changed today among the urban young people. The roles have changed as society has changed, there is no such common culture as there has been before. People have more choices and possibilities. You can live where you want, do what you want, be with whom ever you want, whatever you want freely. There is no such obligation. There is a lot of choice. I think that is good. You can choose what to do. As the roles*| *|  gender roles have been changing, I am really worried. (*| *| ) There is no such masculine role model. Or in fact there are many models for the man to behave. Earlier I spoke about the army, that is one but there is also a softer model for a man and many more. |*| 2 | (*| *| ) |*| 3 | R: For example, if women today have to be good girlfriends, be good at work and be good students and have the energy to do this and to do that, go everywhere. The role of a man has become really shifting. I think that there are quite many models. Media is saying that a man should be somewhat soft. A role like that is given. At the same time, it is unclear what is the thing. I for example didn’t feel good in a relationship as I would have wanted to say that I feel really bad. I don’t like to reconcile myself to this kind of things. I presumed that if I don’t say out loud my own opinions and that if I keep my mouth shut and do the way the other person wants, then everything is well. I realised that it is not like that at all. I have realised that whatever is being said, women do not necessarily like the fact that a man is soft and does everything that is being asked and does not resist. When I was younger, I felt that there is a strong pressure to be like that. If I just said that in the military service one has to be tough, but after it there is not so much such model. It is being pressed everywhere that a man has to be soft and obedient and keep his mouth shut and do not say his needs out loud.  |*| 4 | (*| *| ) |*| 5 | R: My experience is that there is a conflict of pressures in relation to how one is really like and how one is expected to behave and according to which model. When one is younger, around twenty, maybe more or maybe less, one is really exposed to all these kinds of influences. I was as well. How to behave... I was worrying what other people say and think. I think that I represent a sex that has to act according to the new roles. However, that has not felt like my thing.  |*| 6 | At the same time, I see that the role of women is changing so that efficiency is being highlighted whereas the role of men has narrowed all the time. I think that the importance of men has declined. I have been thinking if this makes any sense. What is the value of a man? Does a man have any value anymore? I felt this as reaaaally pressing at some point.  |*| 7 | (*| *| ) |*| 8 | R: The role of a man  is changing and that in a way... What is the value of a man? I think that people behave badly towards men. A good example of this is that*| *|  I can give you a concrete example. Maybe a year ago I was in a bar with my girlfriend in the city center. We were leaving. My girlfriend, she had a lot of clothes with her. Lots to wear. We went to the couch. We put our jackets there and started to put on the extra shirts. It was really confined there and I was putting a shirt on. Al the sudden someone maybe*| *|  I am 25, so a woman 10 years older than me, well-groomed, looking prosperous, smart and everything came and pushed me. “Get out of the way, I am going to the couch”. I dropped my stuff and said that you cannot just do like that. My girlfriend was watching. I said to the woman that you cannot behave like that towards strangers. I said it amicably. I said that I was not going to just accept someone pushing me like that. I was not mean but I thought that this is not OK. She was really surprised that a man, a young man, contradicts her. She was really well-groomed and really self-confident. She was really surprised that a younger man contradicted her, even though I said it in a friendly manner. She said she was sorry. “Sorry that I pushed you and pushed my way between you and your woman”. \""It is OK, you are forgiven but I don’t think it is a right thing to do that; you pushed your way there\"". That was when I felt it. I don’t want to judge or be smarter than what I am, but I felt it clearly that she behaved like that because she felt that she can do it, as she is better positioned. As she has a better job or education or is more well-off. That’s why she can behave like that. I felt that the fact that I am a man had an effect on her behaving like that towards me. Funny thing is that even though I behaved like I behaved*| *|  I don’t know if that is chauvinist behaviour but I told her that “don’t behave like that, you don’t have the right to treat me like that”. I don’t know how I am supposed to call that. It was funny that my girlfriend, even though she sometimes comments on some things that I do, liked a lot what I did. I was surprised about that. I was sure that she would comment that 'was it necessary to open your mouth'. In fact she really liked it that I contradicted her [the woman]. That is funny because it is not really said out loud in public that I can contradict someone like that. She clearly liked it that I behaved like that, which was surprising to me.  |*| 9 | (*| *| ) |*| 10 | R: I went out drinking with another guy. A good friend. We were in a nightclub in the city center. We were enjoying ourselves and drinking. We had not seen each other for a long time. Then all of a sudden two young girls, about 18 years old, come there. We had not spoken with them during the whole evening. They just came and told me and my friend that “We have run out of money. Can you offer us drinks?” I am normally quite quick-witted. I was just*| *|  I could not respond. We just started to laugh with my friend. It was an absurd situation. We just started to laugh. We didn’t say anything.

If we are there, that does not mean that we want to offer drinks to strangers. I felt cheap. Like I was being treated like an object. I have the picture clearly in my mind. I have never really told this to anyone. I felt stupid, like what do you think I am? How stupid are you? I felt that it was insulting. The two stories that I have told during the last 15 minutes are examples of situations where I have felt that women treat me in a certain way. Just because I am a man. (...) |"

In the primary school, I was forced to dance ballet for six years. I have a mother and two big sisters. The memories I have from early childhood are such as I was being laughed at as I was wearing a swimming suit for girls. I have used*| *|  I had to use clothes such as pantyhose for girls. My mother thought that it was not necessary to buy me new clothes as the old ones also fitted me. This is the way primary school and early childhood caused me complexes. In the sixth grade, I started to break loose from this strange ballet world. I started to stay with friends and act like they did, as I thought that is a more masculine way to behave. There was a radical change. I abandoned most of the friends from the elementary school. I started to hang out with people who had*| *|  Gang identity was involved as well as acting macho. Everyone was acting like they were more masculine or able than others. What we did was not sustainable. The summer after the sixth grade we were going around in the city, started the day at ten in the morning and mugged people. It related to.. We had to prove many things to ourselves and others. We had to prove that we are not cowards, we had to prove that we are able to do what we do. That we are tough guys. Nobody can be troublesome with us and nobody is tougher than us. We had principles. Even though it was irrational violence every day, one of the principles was that the victim has to be bigger than us. Older, bigger, stronger. At the end... It was a growth period. A pilot phase that lasted for a long time. It was related to proving that I am a man. All kinds of robbing, everything that juvenile offenders do was what we did. Partly this... In addition that this was related to proving to be a man, it was also genderless gang identity and peer pressure. One for all and everyone in the same situation. On one hand, there were also girls along. I gained a reputation as a tough guy in the city and among friends, that I will and can do whatever I want. Perhaps the fact that I had gained something revoked the need to prove something.  |*| 2 | Luckily, I had the people who were in the same class in the upper level of comprehensive school. Unlike in the primary school, the division between girls and boys was strong. The days when I went to school, I spent with the boys and they were all really eager to study. Everyone was smart, did sports and me*| *|  My image of manhood started to be reformulated. The foolishness I had done did not seem to fit in with that category of a man. It was more related to being responsible and organised and smart. Final*| *|  Many little things*| *|  For sure the sanctions by my mother and her support were related to the fact that I moved to another path of searching for manhood, I started to study. On one hand*| *|  During the upper level of comprehensive school people shoot up, but I didn’t. I stayed shorter than the other boys and felt a need to compensate that. I was beaten once and that, in addition to being short, had such an impact on me that during the eight and nineth grade, especially during the eight grade, I*| *|  I was complexed as I was short and thought that responsibility and intelligence are related to being a man. I spent the whole year without seeing my friends and going*| *|  Doing homework and being in the gym as much as possible. I felt that if I am not as tall as other boys/men, I have to stronger than all of them. If I am not as tall as the other boys, I have to be smarter than all of them. Simply like this. I graduated from the upper level comprehensive school with the highest possible grade. I was*| *|  I attained*| *|  I wanted*| *|  It was not enough. I could not prove anything to myself if I had not proved it to all others. This is how I*| *|  I was not studying because I wanted to learn but because I wanted the scholarship of the best student, just to get it official that I am a man. That was the starting point. I wanted to prove to people. With the gym, it was the same. I trained so much that I finally was stronger than everyone of the same age whom I knew. Studying had a lot of long term effects, even though I cut loose of that too. Even though the starting point was proving that I am a man and compensating my shortness, going to school started to have a life of it’s own. It became a routine and things became interesting. I wanted to know more.  |*| 4 | R: The nitty-gritty in principle is that the quest for manhood led to two opposite directions or periods in my life. First it led to violence and foolishness and then to absolute discipline and life under discipline. For both of the periods, the background was that I wanted to prove that I am a man.  |*| 6 | R: In principle it was manifested in such a way that I set an agenda for myself. I will become strong, I will be the best student in the school. I followed this agenda every second. For a year, a year and a half, I cut down everything that was unnecessary and was related to doing nothing. I developed myself every second. I had routines that I followed strictly.  |

Through this, the search of manhood has directed almost everything (in my life) excluding the near past. First example of this relates to the obligatory military service in Finland.  |*| 2 | (...) |*| 3 | I decided to take the army as a project of growing to manhood. At that point, the image of a man (in my mind) was someone who can make difficult decisions quickly, is good at handwork [can build, construct, is good in woodwork etc.], responsible, capable of coherent action, meaning that life is not full of projects lasting just for one week but the fact that there is continuity. I associated this to manhood. I presumed that I would gain these male capabilities by joining the military service. So I enrolled for the military service. I also made a deal with myself that if the military service will not make me a man, I have to do something after it in order to become a man. The initial plan was to go to Alaska to work at a sawmill. I don’t know why but I thought that there I will become a man. |*| 4 | [He decided not to go to Alaska after all but instead to go to Lapland] |*| 5 | (...) |*| 6 | R: I discovered that the smartest solution is to go to the woods for a longer time. A year after the end of the military service, I packed my backpack with items such as rubber boots, pan and food for six weeks. I travelled to Lapland.  |*| 7 | (...) There I met the examples of such people that represented my ideal of a man. They had such characteristics. I hanged out with gold diggers. There was just an empty cottage and... I spent three weeks like this. Some of the people there were ex-peacekeepers, some of them border guards and all these kind of masculine people who preached about manhood. How that affected on me, was that I realized that I will never become such a man. I also realized that my ideal of a man is somewhat old fashioned. (...)  I started to develop my perception of manhood, after having had these extreme examples and after, in principle, having abolished my own image of manhood. (...) I was maybe 19 years old when I realized that there is no universal ideal of manhood. That I should forget the idea of becoming a man and aim at my personal well-being. I should create such a place where I feel at home. I have been on that road for a very long time. (...) |*| 9 | R: Ready to make decisions, responsible, able to have a life that does not consist of opinions and projects that change weekly, capable of continuity, skillful. In fact I bypassed everything I would have been skillful in and instead affiliated to this manhood everything that was missing from me. Such as woodwork skills, everything that I supposed people do at their summer houses. What else is done there... raking, joinery etc. I also affiliated renovation work to the same category. That’s how I understood manhood then.  |*| 10 | (...) |*| 12 | R: The quick wits, strength of mind in general, ability to make decisions, being outspoken, ability to be at ease everywhere. I usually, no matter where I go, hide behind a corner. I have always envied people who are able to chat with everyone and be at ease everywhere. I used to associate this to manhood very closely. Also being well organised was associated to that. Those where the characteristics I envied in men. Also activeness. But that is something I might have envied in everyone, not just in men.  |*| 13 | (...) |*| 15 | R: Indeed. I think it relates to the change in my range of thought and change in my social circles. I moved to the academic circles and stayed abroad for a year. In fact, it turned out that in (the place A in Europe) I represented the man I had aspired to become to the (citizens of the place A in Europe), as their whole world was so different. The way my ideal of a man changed was that I realised that there is no ideal man, only what I wanted to be. I have still not yet reached the end of that path*| *|  (...) |

Maybe it was more in the countryside*| *|  It might be that in cities it was not considered so bad anymore. At that time, I felt that a woman is alone in a divorce situation. Luckily, divorce seminars are being organised. There were men and women in the same seminar which I found quite fruitful. Many male points of view came out. As a woman, I did not understand that a man feels like that. We talked about saying no for sex. I said that of course you can say no. I have said no and turned down a man. The men there said that you cannot and that a man has to be able, always. It is not like that. |*| 9 | (...) |*| 10 | R: In the countryside, you are supposed to stay in a marriage if you have married. Maybe the milieu there is so small and introverted that people know each other’s business. In the city here, it is quite different, we are able to live here quite anonymously. I felt that I was blamed also from the side of my husband’s siblings. We called to each other quite a few times at that time but at the moment we are not in contact anymore. They thought that I should still have taken care of this old man. |*| 11 | (...) |*| 12 | R: Traditionally, it is so that even if we are seemingly monogamous in Finland, it is still like that that women... at least women of my age, are called for to be flexible. A woman is supposed to be permissive even if the man makes errors. I suppose women are being judged more easily as a woman is a mother. I felt it when I lived in (place A). I felt a divorced woman was being controlled a bit more. People wanted to know where she moves. Whether there are men who come. It is sure divorced women are being controlled more. |*| 13 | (...) |*| 14 |    |

I think that at the workplace womanhood has both helped me and been an obstacle. I think that my being a mother has brought a certain softness to the workplace. Especially as a team leader, one has understood the problems of young women better. I for example, have not pressured women if they have been absent from work due to the illness of their children. Also, as a woman, I have had the courage to try new things and new tasks at the workplace. In many workplaces, at the end of the 80’s and beginning of the 90’s there were many changes that came. In my workplace, the job I had had for 15 to 20 years was under a threat of suspension. I was courageous and started to learn new tasks. Therefore I kept my job. But it was not easy. It was not always good to penetrate to the so called men’s area of work. There were disputes at work and I even had to turn to the employees*| ´*|  health care. I took care of the issue and eventually my superviser changed. |*| 2 | (...) |*| 3 | I think that womanhood has helped me at the workplace even though sometimes I have had to search for my place. I think one needs to call for one’s rights at the workplace and not always give in, especially if the supervisor is a man. Especially before, at the end of the 60’s and in the 70’s, men and women were not equal. There was so-called men’s work and women’s work. I never agreed with that. A woman can do the so-called men’s work as well.   |*| 5 | R: Physically more challenging work was considered men’s work. However, there was also such work that was just assigned (to be men’s work). That a man drives a car at the workplace, that a man picks up the post, picks up the equipment. The stone laboratory is a man’s world and no woman has a place there. However, the physical challenges are not so great when there are auxiliary equipment. No machines are so scary, grinding machines etc. One just needs to become familiar with them and protect oneself always. The drills and saws are not so special. We went drilling to sample pieces and it was preferably always a man who went there. However, a woman could do well there too. It was nice for a change as we always sat inside the laboratory. One could go out and do some more pleasant work for a change. |*| 6 | (...) |*| 7 | R: I would say that a woman is more willing to experiment new tasks and more social. As there are fights in each workplace, I find that women are more willing to discuss and change practices at the workplace. A woman does not say that “this is the way we are used to doing this”. There where lots of trainees that we taught and I think that women welcomed the trainees better than the men. The women took the trainees as an extra hand and did not adopt an attitude that “I know this better”. The customers were always men, engineers. When I worked with a trainee at the stone laboratory, the customers always turned to the trainees and started to explain why they are there, until the trainee explained that this is the laboratorian, not me. She knows things better.  |*| 9 | R: Yes  |*| 11 | R: Yes. Women are also more patient and more flexible, although during a certain period in their lives they are rushing to get home to take care of the children. My experience, however, is that women are more flexible at work. I was a team leader the last few years of my professional career and there were a lot more disputes with male than female colleagues. The men had problems in accepting a woman as a team leader. Sometimes I needed help from my superior in order to solve the problems with them. |*| 13 | R: In the last years we had a team meeting once a week. I realized that these men are quiet in the team meeting but when they went out of the meeting room, I heard afterwards [that they said], that \""she is just in need for recognition\"". They did not help at all to improve practices. They were just searching for mistakes and telling that this is the way it has always been done. It was really hard for them to accept improvements, especially for older men. |*| 15 | R: It might be a trace of something everlasting. That it is a man who decides. When I started in this workplace at the beginning of the 60’s, the supervisors were always men. I guess it is a trace from the past, that a man gives the orders. It is my impression that it is difficult for men to take orders from women. |*| 17 | R: I am sure about that. I felt it was easier when younger men started working there. I think young people are more flexible already. I see it clearly that nowadays young men are different than the men of my age. |*| 19 | R: (...) It is easier to ask that \""what is it, is there a problem at home\""? I think women have a better network in the workplace, they discuss with each other about difficult issues as well. Especially as there are difficult relationships, help is needed. Women are able to be more empathetic and have ability to discuss issues.  |*| 20 | (...) |*| 21 | R: Looking back, I think women should have the courage - I don’t know if young women have the courage nowadays – to seize the moment and not to be satisfied of whatever they are being given at the workplace. I would say many women are 20, 30, 40 years in an unsatisfying work relationship and are suffering, instead of starting to study or even rebel. It might be possible to change jobs inside a big company. |*| 22 | (...) |*| 23 | R: I have been in training courses where there were only 1 or 2 women. At the closing ceremony, someone said that “you are a nice fella”. Does one need to be considered as a nice fella [=a man] in order to be accepted by men? It was a very male atmosphere. (=talks about a trade union where she was active) As a woman, you were expected to please the men and let them make approaches on you. There a woman needs to be tough in order to go forward (with her career), a soft woman is not able to cope there.  |*| 25 | R: Not so nice all the time. One needs to hide the soft side of oneself and deny the womanhood in a sense. You are not allowed to be attractive and competent at the same time. That bothered me and that’s why I left the trade union. I felt the movement had nothing to offer for me anymore. (...) |"

That the divorce was my choice and that I have chosen to ruin the life of my children. That was the message and that was the most difficult thing to bear at that point. That was really surprising, especially when I heard it from different directions. From my family, from the environment, from friends. At that point it was not so rare to get a divorce in our society. This was the story which continues so that the girls have moved out, they have done well and no man has been chosen to take care of the family survival. |*| 2 | (...) |*| 4 | R: (...)*| *| when he closed the door of the family home, he excluded the family life altogether. In as sense, he only took care of those things that were his responsibility and had been agreed. Everything else was my responsibility. He picked up the kids only when we had agreed so and brought them back. But he didn’t take care of other things. He thought they were not his business. It was also surprising as everything what family life is, practical arrangements, driving of three kids and things like that, he forgot it immediately. Every time it was necessary to ask separately when something was needed.  They (the kids) had hobbies and needed rides or something else. It was necessary to ask, I or the girls had to ask each time. |*| 5 | (...) |*| 6 | R: (...) Somehow, even though I don’t remember if anyone said it to me directly, but it was readable between the lines, (that people were waiting) that when shall I take a man to take care of everything and put things forward? |*| 7 | (...) |*| 8 | R: In the beginning, like I said, I was broken. I was also wondering if I will survive. There are many things that have to be taken care of and now I am taking care of them alone. I felt like that when there was pressure from outside that you cannot cope alone. You have to manage everything as there are things that you have done together and of course there are roles in the family. Men take care of men’s issues and women take care of women’s issues a bit more. Then you have to handle it alone. It felt really bad. First the surprise and then it really felt bad that there are people around me who think that I cannot make it alone. Of course there was a counter-reaction that I will show everyone that I can make it, no matter what they say. The everyday life, experiences and everything indicated that \""why would I not make it? No problem. I can dig the car from the snowdrift without anyone doing that for me in the morning. I can put the car heating on\"". (...) |"

To live alone with myself. I don’t want a relationship. I have chosen it as it feels like my thing to do. This way I can live the life that I want. It wins the thought of living in a relationship. Now when I am thinking about it, about my network and people whom I know, I was surprised. There are women of different ages in my social circle and in fact I have also spoken with them about the issue. It does not only mean that I have made this choice at this point in my life, but that women of different ages make the choice that they want to live their life alone. Of course, the situation can change but what does this tell about our world at this moment? Somehow I think that there are much more men who live alone but when one really starts to think about it from the point of view of one’s social circle, I think there are many women who live alone. I have talked about it with some and in fact it is so that as a woman I can make this choice in the Finnish society. I live, do well and enjoy my life. I can truly say that I enjoy my life. I am not missing anything. This is the life that I have chosen. This is it.   |*| 4 | In fact, people do not really talk about it. I don’t talk about it much. Somehow I think that in women’s circles it is sometimes being discussed, but I think that normally it is an issue not being talked about.

Of course, I am so old that in my case not so much... However, I think that the choice of younger women to live alone is not being questioned anymore or thought that it is just a temporary choice like “you will find a man soon etc.” Somehow I think there is not so much of that anymore.

When I was under 10 years old, it did not make a difference whether you were a boy or a girl because girls and boys were about the same size. Actually, girls are a bit bigger than the boys of the same age. I did really well in football. So well that I was actually better than boys. During the breaks in school I played football with boys and a few times a week I had trainings with a football team for girls. At that time it did not necessarily make a difference whether you were a boy or a girl. Maybe parents were more ambitious in relation to the football hobby of boys than girls. The parents of the girls were not there to heatedly cheer for their kids in the trainings, unlike it was in the trainings of the boys' team. |*| 2 | When I was older I continued to play football and went to a sports-oriented high school.

I work in the forestry sector and I have studied forestry. The Finnish forestry sector is quite traditional. It is considered a men’s sector. Traditionally there were a lot of men and few women but nowadays the situation is different. The sex ratio is maybe 40 percent of women and 60 percent of men. Already during the student days, certain traineeship placements were meant for boys and others for girls. Or that’s how it seemed. For example, men could have a summer job in a place where physical strength is needed, like at factories, saw mills or others. Women were not chosen for that type of work and I guess not many even applied.

Even though 40 percent of students are women and 60 percent are men, most people in work life within the sector are men. If you are a woman, perhaps it is an advantage. However, it is not given you for free. First, you have to prove that you are worth the trust, before getting in that position. “Nice fellas”, nice people, easy-going women are appreciated in the forestry sector. In principle, you have to be like the men. Of course, it depends on the working place, but that’s how I feel. This also applies when you are a student. Those girls who were “nice fellas” were liked. Also in the working life, there is an advantage to be a woman if you are a “nice fella”. However, you are not automatically a “nice fella”, you have to work for that and bring it out.  |*| 4 | R: There is a tradition in Finland that after meetings there are social events, which include going to sauna and eating together. That is somewhat difficult if you are an only woman in the group. It is not appropriate to go to the sauna with men, it is not normal. The sauna is particularly such a place where you could be a nice fella. Easy-going, nice, conversational. However, if you cannot go to the sauna, how can you be that? You have to bring it out somewhere else.  |*| *|  Or how do I know, maybe they study those issues secretly? However, I think that I have needed to work extra in order to know things well enough and be credible that way. Of course, it is related to the fact that I am a young woman in the Finnish forestry sector. Maybe that is the formula. Somehow I think that as a woman it is possible to do well in working life if you just want. Also in a male dominated sector but it requires more work. You have to have a good personality and it requires more work. If you don’t try, then you necessarily*| *|  will not advance with your career. Whereas the men can end up to become a manager even without trying. Women have to try in order to move forward.  |*| 8 | R: I don’t know. I think that in a situation where the manager level positions are being distributed it does not matter but when the tasks are being given, that’s when it matters. Certain tasks are being given to men and certain to women. Often the tasks that are given to men might be more meaningful. They might lead to something. For example, of those people whom I studied with, many women do not hold a permanent position. They have been to several fixed term contracts whereas my closest male fellow students already hold manager level jobs or have had a permanent job since the beginning. They have positions such as surveying manager, which does not sound very feminine. In fact, I would not be interested in that. Maybe men accept such tasks more easily, which then lead to a more direct career path. (...) |

I have tried different sports when I was little, because my mum is a teacher in physical education. Ballet, gymnastics, skating.. all these kinds of feminine sports. My mum would have hoped me to start dancing as it had been her dream that never came true. My mum has also always admired opera and high culture. That’s why I started to play the cello. Classical instruments are often perceived as girly stuff.  |*| 2 | (*| *| ) In fact I would have truly wanted to play football. I played football and floorball a lot with my friends in the yard. We also did skipping and other girly things. I did not have the courage to ask (to start playing football as a hobby), even though my mum would have been excited about it. I have afterwards talked about it with her and she said “why didn’t you ask me” but there was a barrier. Somehow I was always pushed to this kind of.. I guess I wanted to start all these hobbies as I am a person who does not do anything if I don’t want to. I quit the ballet because I didn’t like it and I quit skating as I would have wanted to compete but I was put to the beginners group, surprise surprise. I was somewhat impatient. In the beginning, the ballet was just jumping and nothing that looked cool was actually being done. I think football would have been a good sport for me as you can start playing immediately. When I went to the upper level comprehensive school, there was already a big barrier to start a team sport. At that point, I thought it is difficult to get in on something like that so I just forgot my wish. I did not have the courage to start something that would have been perceived as a masculine sport. It is a common perception that all football players are lesbians and floorball players are lesbians (laughs) and all women who do team sports are lesbians. When I was little, I did not think about that but in the high school I did. |*| 3 | And again, my father would not have been excited about football as a hobby even though my mum would have been. I never had the courage to propose. My dad is quite conservative and hard-and-fast. He is very critical on how a woman should be like as his mum was a housewife and his father was a career father in a high position. They were wealthy, not rich but wealthy. On my dad’s side, the people do not get fat even if they eat extra.  |*| 4 | (*| *| ) On my mum’s side, everyone is short and rotund. I think my dad did not like it when I was not very thin first. In the beginning I was, like around the age of five, but after that I was too fat according to my dad. I got an eating disorder. First I had anorexia and then bulimia but then I did an exchange year in (country a) and there I recovered. I returned and decided that these stupid things will end now, I will start doing sports. I had just done jogging before. I had not gone to the gym or done any sport that would have been encoded either male or female. Jogging is something that everyone can do. But then I started the body pump as one of my friends went there. It is gymnastics done with weights. It is a really girly thing, no boys go there. My father never realised that. When I started to go often to the body pump, I became somewhat muscular, especially as I had a bit of weight. I had recovered from the eating disorder and gained weight and become a bit muscular but that was not good enough (for my father). He commented on that saying “don’t go to the body pump, that is not feminine to have muscles. Soon you will become a bodybuilder”. I tried to explain that no I won’t. It is impossible, even if you go there 8 times a week. It is an endurance sport. But my father did not like it. A while ago he had an opinion that I am anorectic and too thin. Nothing is good enough for him. I don’t know how this is related to womanhood but he has this picture in his head that you cannot have muscles nor extra kilos. You cannot be too thin but anyhow you are supposed to be. Nothing is good enough. |*| 5 | (...) |*| 6 | R: My mom never prohibited me to eat something but my dad had comments like ”(the name of the respondent), this Christmas you will not eat any chocolate. You have eaten enough of it.” My mum has always been very supportive when I have been on a low carb diet. It helps me to recover from bulimia.  |*| 7 | (...) I think I would not have got the eating disorder if I had been a boy. I don’t know. I don’t think my father would have pressured a boy child or been watching what I can eat and what I cannot eat and how I am supposed to look like. (...) |

Like when I was young, my mom always told me that when she was in school she could only move up to the next grade conditionally because she was so bad at maths. She told me how bad she was at maths and how she never knew any maths and how she had to be in remedial instruction. Somehow I thought that I am also very bad at maths as my mother is very bad at maths. In general, the attitude of the people is that girls are not so good at that. In fact I was always very good in maths but I was also very interested in languages. In high school when we had to choose between a more demanding maths course and a less demanding one, I still chose the more demanding one. However, I had also chosen two languages at a more demanding level, German and English. I thought that I had no time to put effort in studying maths and my grades went down. As I didn’t put effort in studying maths, I decided to leave it out and concentrate on studying languages. One of the maths teachers thought that maths at a more demanding level is not a subject girls can be good at. I think this was one of the reasons why I didn’t have so much motivation in learning it anymore. The teacher had this preconceived idea that you cannot keep up one's end. As I also had some sort of preconceived idea that I most likely cannot make it as my mother didn’t make it either, I thought that maybe this is not my thing after all. I concentrated on studying languages in high school, which led me to the university to study languages. Maybe I could have become a maths teacher. I think that learning maths has always been fun but at that point keeping up with the advanced level maths course was too much.  |*| 3 | I also chose something somewhat differently during my time in school. I usually chose a bit more girly subjects. However, in the primary school I had six months of handicraft and six months of technical work. I was really bad at handicraft, I didn’t understand anything about sewing machines and I always sewed on my finger. So I chose differently and chose technical work while all the other girls chose handicraft. Many people wondered why I just didn’t choose handicraft. That don’t I think at all that when I get older and I am in a relationship, the situation will be that both of us will only know how to do the men’s work (laughs). That we will not be able to do different things. Actually thinking back about this, it is a little bit difficult because I will have a housewarming party next week and I should make a fairy costume for myself. I would know how to construct an electric lamp but I don’t know how to sew a fairy costume. Luckily, my flatmate will help me with this. I think that I cut loose on the typical role that was expected of me in this case. I am actually very happy that I did this because I was really good at technical work and think that the things that we did in the class were much easier and enjoyable for me compared with the things done in the handicraft class. At the moment, it is so that my boyfriend and I both know how to construct the furniture but neither of us knows how to sew buttons. Luckily, we have mothers and flatmates who help*| *|  I am not sure if I have more to tell on school*| *|   |*| 4 |   |*| 6 | R: I think that all the teachers I had are really good... I had just two teachers in technical work, one at the lower level of comprehensive school and the other at the upper level of comprehensive school because in the high school we didn’t study technical work anymore, or at least not in my high school. I would not have chosen it even if it would have been possible. Both of the teachers were really nice and in fact there were a few other girls in the class besides me as well. The teacher at the upper level of comprehensive school told me... I got a very good grade in technical work but no other girl got as good a grade as I did. So the teacher commented that it is really good that I work independently as the other girls wait for the other girls to do a certain thing and don’t have the courage to work if their friend is not there. I think that in my case this actually was because my best friends had not chosen technical work and as I didn’t have much in common with the girls there, I worked independently. Maybe I worked in the same pace with the boys. So the teacher told me that girls are somewhat annoying students in technical work because they always wait for their friend and do not work independently. I think this is the only comment that comes to my mind on how the teacher made a difference between boys and girls. And the teacher also commented that in technical drawing girls are better than boys because that’s when fiddly three-dimensional drawing of lines is needed (laughs). A three-dimensional brick needs to be transferred to lines on a paper. I think all the girls got the best grade on this and boys did not because all they would have wanted to do was to build and not to draw. But the teachers had a positive attitude.  |*| 8 | R: Well*| *|  My mom has always been a strong personality or she has always done things the way she has wanted to, so she has always thought that whatever you do, do it well and it doesn’t matter what you do. But my father is a more traditional person. I think he was somewhat surprised when I didn’t want to do women’s things. On the other hand, I have always been*| *|  Everything else that I have chosen has always been on the line so it didn’t matter too much that I chose technical work. In the other story I can tell you more about my father. My parents have always been encouraging me on what relates to school. I have always been a good student at school. |*| 9 | (...) |*| 11 | R: Because I was bad... I didn’t know how to use sewing machines and didn’t know how to sew. In the first and second grade I was really bad at everything that relates to... I stung on my finger with the needle all the time. I think it was too fiddle work for me. The machines broke down every time when I used them and the thread got stuck... In fact in technical work, the machines are much more dangerous. It does not kill anyone if a little needle penetrates your finger but for some reason for me the needle thing was scarier than to be by a circular saw, which is much more dangerous. Maybe because in technical work the teacher always has an eye on the students at least in the primary school. So if the circular saw is being used he has to be there. Maybe I felt secure because the teacher was there using the saw. In handicraft, you can always operate on your own. Also my mother has always been bad at handicraft and I didn’t learn it either when I was little. In our summer house, I was always busy with woodwork, I build something to crush the blueberries for example. I have kept those things I built. I was not used to sewing when I was a child. Woodwork is more broadminded work. Of course, the work includes for example grinding but it is not fiddly work. I think that is the difference. |*| 13 | R: I think they were more wondering why I want to do something like that.. On one hand, everybody is laughing as my mum is not good at it either, so it is no wonder that I didn’t do anything I was really bad at. It might be also that as my sister is really good at all this kind of stuff. She is really talented in drawing. She is a hairdresser and a dressmaker by occupation. She is really oriented in all this kind of stuff. Maybe it is natural that if there are two kids they become different. I don’t know if people would have had a more negative attitude if both of us had chosen technical work. I don’t know if people had thought that they are bringing up lesbians in my family. I think it is OK if one makes a different choice than the other. The other one is free to choose differently. Like my sister went to occupational school so in one sense I was left with the university. So we made different choices. And she takes good care of herself, her hair is always nice and she has always lots of make-up. Well, of course she has to because of her profession, as she has to be a commercial of her own work. I really suck, I barely know how to braid hair. I know how to dry hair and make something else. I am not sure if this answered your question*| *|  |*| 14 | (...) |*| 16 | R:  It is a common stereotype. That’s what I think. Women’s business is to study languages and men’s business is to count numbers. |

To say*| *| I do understand that my sister or my cousin are equal to me. There doesn’t have to be any difference. If my sister has sex with more men, this doesn’t mean she is more of a whore than before. It’s just a situation. Regarding this, I personally believe in equality. Indeed*| *| I usually support that by being involved in politics in favor of that. I don’t think there has to be any difference in regard to education or culture due to being born male or female. But here in Spain we have a backwardness related to Francoism, the culture of repression, Catholicism, Christianity, which still influences many families.  |

They were interested and the fact that I played hockey seemed interesting to them. As if I was a strange person. Weird things tend to attract people. Or things that are not common. But I have girl friends that because of playing football or things like that were classified as if they were boys. If you dress in a normal way, like everybody else, and you don’t wear tracksuits, you are never marked like that. But if you wear tracksuits or dress in a certain way they tend to say that you are masculinized. And I don’t think so. I know many people who are very feminine and wear tracksuits.  |

There is a time in which gender differences stand out, but we’ll talk about them later. At the same time I belong to a generation that become to give the first steps towards a lesser gender discrimination. Let’s see it now. The first discrimination I remember was related to the family realm. It was taken for granted*| *|  We are two siblings, a man and a woman, our roles were taken for granted. Fortunately, we were a very liberal family. I had great and liberal parents. There were different roles, I was a man and my sister was a woman. How do these roles become specific? When you are young, it meant that you can do some things like smoke, go to a bar, come home late at night, and this is more permitted for you than for your sister who is a female. Obviously, at that time the women who smoked weren’t accepted. Men were. A man who went to bars and played cards, as I did when I was a teenager, was accepted. My sister was a woman and couldn’t. And we are talking about two people who were studying [at university], with a certain level*| *| At that point, I wasn’t aware of the situation at all. I profited from it and enjoyed it but I wasn’t aware of it. Afterwards I was, thanks, among other things, to my sister. Besides, to go out on the town and this kind of thing was mixed up with another issue, sexuality, which at that time was crucial. I belong to a generation where*| *| This was pure Francoism, with a strong influence of the Catholic Church, so sexuality was forbidden. You were always told to ‘be careful with*| *| ’, ‘be careful with what you do*| *| ’. But this situation of, let’s say repression, was much harder for women than for us. We were privileged. Just because of biological egoism. Obviously, men wouldn’t get pregnant and it would be a shame if a girl showed up pregnant  |*| 3 | (...) |*| 4 | R: There was a clear inequality. I mean, a man could do some things, which were allowed, permitted, while women were not allowed that much.  |*| 5 | (*| *| ) |*| 7 |  (...) |*| 8 | R: A man could date any woman, but a woman couldn’t.

My sister, who wasn’t married the first year, was living with a man. My situation was acceptable. What caused headaches [to my parents] was my sister’s situation. When my sister told them she was getting married my parents breathed a sigh of relief. Nothing would have happened if I hadn’t gotten married (...) |*| 11 | My sister and I talked a lot, a lot. We had conversations. I think she was the one who raised my awareness regarding the discrimination that was taking place and to which I was contributing unawares. For instance, I remember*| *| *| *| It came mainly from there. And also, in the first place this came from my sister, but afterwards I met women who were studying careers, and who shared their thoughts about these things  |*| 12 | (...) |*| 13 | R: One day my mother confessed to my sister and I that she was afraid that something might happen to my father. And I said why? Because if your father dies what will we do for a living. Sure, the family income belonged to my father.  So my mother was scared about my father dying. Then, what would we do for a living? Even if it doesn’t seem so, these sorts of things are seeds that stay inside you. And I say to myself, yes, I was progressively saying, ‘Look, how unfair it is! They are working all day and she still depends on my father’s money. He’s nice, he’s a good person. But she depends on my father’s money!’. It’s a very unfair situation. She’s not getting any income. At this point I might not have been aware of it, but all these things were penetrating [my mind]. They were raising awareness. It happened to me at least.  |*| 14 | (....) |*| 15 | R: [This had an influence] Yes, totally. Totally. I began to be determined to make my own bed, to take care of my room. Things like that. Not to give my mother work. To treat my sister differently. More as a colleague than*| *| To understand some issues. This is connected to what is called the Oedipus complex, isn’t it? A bit of rebelliousness against your father, saying, ‘Hey, look!’. But, of course, he wasn’t guilty. In his time he didn’t have much freedom to act. Yes, these are small facts about which I say, yes, they changed me a lot.   |

If at that point, in 1974, my husband called the police and asked for them to look for me at the place I had been hired in city A, where I was living on my own, I would have had to go and live with him again.  If he had gone to the court and said that his wife was not living with him. Yes, and if at that moment they found me committing adultery I would go to prison, me and the man who would be called ‘the adulteress’ mail’. It was legally termed this way. Nothing would have happened to him but I could go to prison. This wasn’t the case, but it might have been. And in 1981 I got divorced, by mutual consent, and with a legal agreement  |*| 11 | (...)  |*| 12 | R: This was a very hard situation. At this point, I went to visit an attorney and said to him ‘I want to get separated’ and he said ‘why?’. ‘Because I want to’. He said ‘that doesn’t exist [here]. Do you think this is the USA?’. The legislation didn’t include that possibility. There had to be almost a criminal reason for women to get a legal separation. A very strong reason. It might have been a case of domestic violence that had been proven or*| *| Very complicated. And after that, women had to ask for a marriage annulment. There were only religious marriages, there was no civil marriage.  |*| 13 | (....) |*| 14 | R: I got really mad.

Even my parents found that people [that adhered to] order and ‘right-thinking’ stopped saying hello to them. You should bear in mind that in a small city in region A at that moment there might be [just] two or three girls that got separated. Two things were done to them. First, [they experienced] social segregation since they could be a bad example for other girls. Furthermore, there was a sense of misfortune, of someone who is incapable of solving her problems with docility. (*| *| ) |*| 17 | It seemed unacceptable to me! Why on earth should I obey what someone else said in order to work or fulfill my aims!  Come on! This didn’t make any sense.  |*| 18 | (*| *| ) |*| 19 | R: [I found allies] at home. In my family. A full alliance.   |*| 20 | (*| *| ) |*| 21 | R: [The education I got from my family] was crucial. My mother was a teacher. So she is a woman who always had clear that she wanted to study, with a very strong personality. She wanted to escape an environment where her only future was to get married. She was economically independent and she knew for sure that this was a mechanism to assure her self-esteem and a way to be an autonomous person.  She got married late and my father was that way too. He was rather old to get married too. In that sense, I think I come from a peculiar couple (*| *| ) |*| 22 | R: Besides, I was lucky that in city B I was in touch with other women who were peculiar too. Some of them agreed with the social norms in regards to marriage. Others didn’t. So they stayed single since they didn’t want to accept that they had to build their lives in dependence on a man.  |

Although I can admit that I have had open-minded parents, with an attitude let’s say egalitarian, probably their socialization and the habits they were raised on, led inevitably to some fears and inertias to be transferred to their children. Especially in our teens, when the small age gap between me and my brother led me to ask sometimes for doing some activities, especially leisure activities similar to his, and where there was more precaution, prevention or control over my things. I remember particularly one time that was unique, and at that point maybe not traumatic but remarkable. When I was dating my first boyfriend I was late to come back home, as is usual for teenagers, both boys and girls, and I was just in front of my house saying goodbye to him. It wasn’t that late but my father got worried, although he never does, because he’s very calm. He went to look for me and he found me with that guy. And the face and the expression, all was [she opens her eyes showing the kind of face]*| *| he has never had that reaction again in my life.

And it hurt a lot, very much.  |*| 3 | (*| *| ) |*| 4 | R: I judge them here, in a discreet manner without them knowing, but I think it wasn’t*| *| it wasn’t egalitarian at all [sexual education]. It was rather a classic. Be careful, think of what you do, and again think of what you do. This ‘think of what you do’ was always overemphasized due to fact that I was a girl and that I might be involved in an unwanted pregnancy and so on.  |*| 5 | (*| *| ) |*| 6 | R: I had never seen that reaction from my father or my mother if my brother was late. They never went to pick him up, but they did it for me. Secondly, I was saying goodbye to the guy they knew I had been dating for months and it was normal. No, for me this was a way to control. This was my sole flaw. I was a good student, I always behaved properly, but sure I was a girl and that was too much! Or maybe my father saw me younger than I was or just that I was a girl and his gut reaction determined that with me this couldn’t happen. His girl couldn’t. From then on there was a*| *| It never happened to my brothers, never.  |*| 7 | (*| *| ) |*| 8 | R: I changed in the sense that I sought survival strategies thanks to which I hadn’t received that feedback.

When other things happened, I tried to hide some information. It’s a mechanism.  |*| 9 |  (*| *| ) |*| 10 | R: I think it might be a self-defense mechanism for them [my parents] because society was experiencing a sharp change of habits and it had been very culturally and sexually repressed.  |*| 11 | (*| *| )  |*| 12 | R: In case of fear gender mechanisms were there for*| *| .just in case.  |

I needed to enjoy having children and not to change myself because of that. I think that I sometimes felt social pressure.

Especially, [the pressure] came from those mothers that strongly advocate for this kind of maternity that I do not defend, and socially it came from many other people.  You are no longer the centre, you are secondary with respect to the baby. Babies are the focus of the debate. So you must be satisfied with anything that is the best for the babies.  I noticed this kind of pressure. Well, now you*| *| ’Sure, you don’t want to come there, no, because between each breast-feed’*| *| But where does it come from?  If you don’t want you don’t have to do it, but if you do, there shouldn’t be more obstacles than being able to arrange something with your partner. But social pressure is high.  |*| 7 | (*| *| ) |*| 8 | R: I had to deal with my feelings and not to deceive myself, to figure out what I wanted. And I was happy with what I wanted, I am. I clearly see that this [having a child] is another part of my life, that is not disconnected, that must not affect the core of the rest of my life. But I didn’t before. Before having a child it was like, well, let’s see how it goes, who I am, who I will be. Indeed, this story makes a lot of sense to give an example of that. When I was breastfeeding, when I had to come back here, to work, I couldn’t make my child to start using a feeding bottle. I couldn’t make it, there was no teat or feeding bottle that suited him.  Then, I spent two months buying new ones and trying all days, but he wasn’t eating. Until a friend of mine brought me some from the US, she had to bring them just to get that*| *| they looked very much like a nipple.  |*| 9 | (*| *| ) |*| 10 | R: This relation of dependency, of not being able to stay away from my child more than a few hours was very stressful for me. And overall I realized that it wasn’t possible, that my partner couldn’t replace me. The day I managed to do it, I remember as if it was today, and where, because it was here at the university.  My baby sucked through this teat and ate milk. I went to have lunch. Imagine how much I needed that! I went to have lunch with my work colleagues and in the afternoon I went to city A to attend a concert of Caetano. Because after six months I needed very much to know that my son wouldn’t die or that anything would happen if I*| *| It felt like*| *| And I left and nothing happened. My partner used the feeding bottle. I felt that I needed that. But other women don’t. Me, you imagine, it was the first day and I disappeared, I came back home at one in the morning!  |*| 11 | (*| *| ) |*| 12 | R: I needed to have my own room but not stop doing*| *| *| But preconceived ideas do not apply, everyone has her own experience. And overall to listen how you feel about it. There are some people that feel fine, that won’t think about it and therefore for them this is not a big deal.      |

I think my friends have a lot to do with my education and my socialization, with what I see and what I say. When we went out [for a drink], we went to another town 12 km away and normally came back by taxi. But an older man opened a bar in our home town and we used to go there. He was about 35-40 years old.  We were between 16-17 and 20. Or maybe a bit older, between 18 and 20. We used to go out and when he closed the bar he used to come with us and we came back home together. When we were coming home, one of the cockiest guys of the group told us to stop at place A, a brothel, a prostitution club which was well-known in the area, and which happened to be on our way to another town. I felt very embarrassed. I was told at home that prostitution was an unwanted phenomenon, that people don’t do that freely but are forced, or because they need to, they don’t have other means.

She jumped to me and asked, what I am doing and then the discussion went on about studying and what to do after the university. Briefly, a girl classmate, not a boy. Then I finally reached my interest in feminist research and gender studies and then the first thing she said at once, that are you some equal rights person or what. Then, I meant, that I should explain a little. |*| 3 | R: I could not much. She did not care to listen. Then I started to explain that it should concern you. That it concerns exactly you, how can you have a stand like that towards it, that you should be glad that so to say male persons are dealing with that issue. Think about it, what does gender as such mean. But there is that she did not... |*| 5 | R: Yeah, she just laughed. |*| 7 | R: She did not... she could not  say anything, she does not have any humanitarian or social studies education, to absorb it. |

There was a lot of fun. Then I managed to get a pink rucksack for myself from some second-hand, you know, and then it was: are you some faggot or something. It was with joke, I understood that no one is taking it seriously and my brother asks, how can you wear this, is it not strange and is anybody not mocking you – then some 5 or 6 years went on and  when my brother was as old than I was then, it was like that not only he was wearing a pink shirt or jumper, but half of the classmates (---)To wear a pink shirt or  jumper now, you can be a muscle-type, isn*| ´*| t it.

Came at right time and said what he had to say and I was the one with nice voice in that band who gave the pleasant additional nuance, and as the member of the band I have received the attitude and extra bonus, and in fact there were no other girls like this, who took part in such societal critical band.(---) |*| 3 | R: (---) And I was the background singer, but it was talked about, I did not open my mouth too much but have received quite a lot of attention although I did not present myself by appearance or in any other ways, I was quite an ordinary girl in nice, cool clothes, but, however, ordinary. I do not know – a schoolgirl maybe. Nothing revolutionary. I was not a punk chick. And thanks to that NAME 2, who was really a big shot, his fame spread over to me as a woman.

Which is in fact, if to analyse it sociologically or from the viewpoint of gender, it reflects as if classical gender roles.(---)  |*| 2 | R: (---) I am conducting the traditional feminine role in the music scenery, I am a singer. My band*| ´*| s keyboard player is a woman and playing keyboard is also known as a feminine area. Although there are very many male keyboard players, it is considered more feminine or propriate for women, and at the same time I am performing songs created by a man. Male way of thinking, who, however claims that he is writing it from the aspect which is  considering me somehow, in other words, he is somehow as if citing me. And in one word, it is a creation of one man and through my body it reaches others.(---)  |*| 3 | R: (---) When I myself started to research upon women musicians, I did  in fact myself, I started to analyse myself at the same time and I let the things go quite spontaneously in fact, at the same time registering all kinds of interesting signs.(---) |*| 4 | R: (---) At the same  time  I have not as a woman found it neccessary... I am talking about creaton now, I do not talk about organizing etc. To protest against something or... I  feel it if as very own, this creation, but from the other side I see, yes, that in fact some codes can be read from this. (---)  |*| 5 | R: (---) I have not touched upon those issues on purpose.(---)  |*| 6 | R: (---) Briefly I have analysed it, but I have not raised this issue with those men that why you write about women like this. I have rather looked at it from aside and found very many parallels with the women I have myself analysed. (---)  |*| 7 | R: (---) There is a song called Plus 1 and it tells about how the so called women, so called groupies of V.J.s. I do  not think that he kept me in mind but briefly some kind of socialisation goes on where women are groupies and are fixing themselves in to the playlists of cool DJs, playlists of partys and also life playlists, to tell it straightforward.(---)  |*| 8 | R: (---) Maybe sometimes I feel the lack of some egoism, to be more like a boss of myself. (---) |*| 9 | R: (---) Sometimes I have noticed, less and less by the way, that I have had to make efforts to assert myself, in the beginning there was much like that, the final words were  very logically, said like, without me. Then I came into studio next time and found that ou- ou, you have decided it without me. Although in fact I could, I liked the decision, but I felt defiance because they did not ask me for example.(---) |*| 10 | R: (---) But not because of that I am a woman they do not ask me, but I just feel that it is natural that why  to disturb, it seems to be unimportant to them.(---) |*| 11 | R: (---) One moment it started to stress me and then one moment I started whimming and after that somehow.(---)  |*| 12 | R: (---) I have yes organized some proper scenes and then after that everybody was very courteous and doing everything.(---)But yes some capricious period lasted something half a year in fact. |*| 13 | R: (---) Another thing in connection with those caprices what I have been thinking again and again that men agree to oblige women very much, in order not to be stamped as bad or somehow, the band is also a kind of family, being friendly, that I feel good also, somehow this solidarity.(---) |

Thank you for the best offer of my life, but I stay here. And, look, this was very difficult to understand for many, that are you an idiot or?(...) |*| 2 | R: (...) Firstly, that it is interesting for me there, but my family does not have anything to do there.(...) But the biggest problem was that the other did not have anything to do there. She would have vegetated there in the same way as she had done by now, she would have been sitting there just like that, I would have been earning money. Wandering around PLACE 2, PLACE 3, it would have been very cool. Because of money I would cut out 2-5 years of my family life.(...) |*| 3 | R: (...) For the two of us  this decision would have  been more difficult, if there were no children, then it would have been like that: would she find any activity, when she would, then there would have been a discussion, because it was about big money. But there were many other arguments, the existence of home above all, the existence of parents.(...) |*| 4 | R: (...)

Being oneself*| ´*| s own employer means more flexible time-table, when my wife is having a so-called steady job  and is earning money, to be one*| ´*| s own employer you have more flexibility. There are those reasons.  |*| 3 | R: (---) If  she could stay at home and I could do more work at home – this would not work out at all. In these five years when she was at home until now, january, she was really, enough, over-loaded. In the moment she is attending two technical schools at one time. PLACE1 and PLACE 2 at once. And she is away for weeks sometimes. Last week she was away and this week she is away. Or, it is not possible any other way, that I have to take over this load. It is like that. It is strange to name it a family project, but it is a common project.   |*| 4 | R: (---) Most men want to be free. Children are women*| ´*| s business. In this sense that when you want to live together, at least a bit, on a more equal basis, then it is not like that: one is the head and the other is the neck and one is the board and the other is the council. Although you can not tell it with humour, but there are no more possibilities than to divide those things between each other. She made this scheme, that she was  because of children at home for five years or thus lost her professional competence, in everything. Qualification disappeared in this time. Lost human contacts. Practically, she was chained to the home for years. Four following summers she could not drink wine, which is very serious. And for four summers in a row. When she gives up so many things... I am not interested in going to pubs or do whatever. Then I would say that I have the right  and I have to get it, have to go and... would I want it if it were like that, in another way? Probably not.  |*| 5 | R: (---)They carry on until now those things, along their families. Where the wife is domestic and does not open her mouth, neither in the company, and the man does, whatever hobbies he might have. Drives rally or goes out... he is, however, the man.  |*| 6 | R:(---) And there were men in the doctoral studies level, when a child was born, after half a year they stayed at home. There was the paternity leave and it was the norm, it was ordinary. Or the employer, be it the university or some business company, will not say what I shall be doing. |*| 7 | R: (---) As far you do not have any children, this is a strange world. No matter what is happening in the other world, it is like some ah-ah. Also those, who had children at the same time in COUNTRY 1 – I did not know anything about this world. |*| 8 | R: (---) 2006 I had the first child. There I took paternity leave for 3 weeks, it seemed normal. (---) Natural that you stay at home and help. Caesarian birth, and of course you need help. Also with the first one. It seemed very natural and there were no conflicts. (---) Especially after the birth of the child I did not take part in company events, that meant I would have to leave the other at home when she needs help. This first guy was not a very easy one. He had a habit not to sleap at the daytime and... at night he even let us sleep, but when you had no possiblity to leave him alone for a moment during the day and when you swing him two-three hours to  sleep for five minutes, this tires you in the end if it continues like that. (---) Say, when I was on the way home around five o*| ´*| clock, driving home, then a phone-call comes: well, how far are you. Then I do not see any reason in the alternative to go to the pub with some colleagues or stay at some sauna-evenings or somewhere, to my mind it is not a reasonable alternative. Really, it was the same at the other employer, every week there were some negotiations, every week some evening. As most of the workers were young and single, others were older with grown-up children, then they did not understand it very well, that why you do not participate or why you do not participate at summer days when the other child is half a year old and the first is already two and a half years old, I have had the experience, the worst age difference that children could have.  |*| 9 | R: (---) You lose when you do not take part in company events. You lose human relations and the others do not understand very well, why you do not participate. Don*| ´*| t you like it? The wife can manage at home, why do not you take part and do not do anything. They do not understand that every minute that I am away is an enormous burden for another, to stay  with two guys like that. There were periods like... periods like two months when you did not get sleep at all, not for even an hour per fortnight (---) it is reasonable that when you have a two-months young baby at home and the other is just under three years, then you do not leave the other at home to go to some PLACE 3 to have fun wth single colleagues. Well, it is not reasonable. Everyone does not share that point.  |*| 10 | R: (---) when the other child was born, the first was two years old, continuously a difficult guy. The other came also by Caesarian birth and then it is that you cannot lift the first, you should not lift him and do whatever and the other needs lot of attention and then the other lacks attention and there is a conflict, then in the year 2008 when  the state payed 100% of the salary in three weeks for father. It was the one year that it was valid, it was a chance. |*| 11 | R: (---) When that time came, I said that someone else must continue the work that I stay home and there is  so much to do  there, that I will not work at home. It was concrete, that it is like that and that there is no discussion. That*| ´*| s it. Later, in the development conversations and other things, probably there remained some conflict to ripen, that is how it all developed, that my attitude, it was considered too arrogant attitude probably. Later I heard it during some conflict again that your attitude is like that, you leave things in a mess and others have to do things for you and you just go away like this. (---) |*| 12 | R: When you yourself have children then you could possibly understand, but I have understood that every parent has a different experience. There are easier children, who sleep well that you have to wake them up for eating and with whom there are no problems. (---) See, then it is like that the other people who are in the management and who had their own families it has been like that, the wife is at home, the wife took care of the children, the man had his business, the woman hers. Children belong to the wife. |*| 13 | R: (---) We hired a baby sitter one moment when the other was some half a year old, finally we found one.(---) |*| 14 | R: When I then stayed at home, during this three weeks there was a younger female colleague from another department, one lady, who was going to have a child herself soon, had asked that what  is he doing there at home? Is he breastfeeding the child himself or? Briefly, that was the worst conflict ever. Not the employer*| ´*| s reproofs that a project is delayed, there was nothing like that, it was not a gendered conflict. Maybe it was but he was a man, he said that it is the pretext, that you want to laze around. But that a young woman said it, this was, I heard it from a third source. It was the strongest conflict ever. (---) What is he doing at home, is he breastfeeding?  |*| 15 | R: (---) Everyone has different agreements: men have total freedom, some woman can be  happy not to have a man as a burden at home all the time, one child less. It can be different. (---)  |*| 16 | R: (---) I have been busy with my preparation works, to be ready for my own business, when the unemployment allowance stops, then it is time to start in full swing and some initial investments are done what are needed for a starting company. Yes, it was difficult to send the bills. When children are at home, even when one child is at home, you cannot get the  work done. Work is not done, you can not send the bill. |*| 17 |   |

It was known that the first year students are sent to the army at the same time as girls stay peacefully at the  university. Clearly very frustrating, very clearly discriminating. There was nothing special... it was the time, when it was said, that in the army younger newcomers are beaten. Very clearly... in this sense a hurting experience that clearly two years of life were lost. When I came back, others are far away, having there own private lives or whatever.(---)  |*| ´*| t know, or was it just some general stupidity? |*| 4 | R: I was quite lucky. But yes a couple of times I was beaten by older doers. It was in this sense, that all of the hell of the thing was not so bad any more, things were going better already. But a couple of times they made it very intensively clear, who controls the hierarchy here.(---) For someone, half a year older than you did not like your face. From REGION 1 countries, with glasses was the sufficient reason to beat you up. |*| 6 | R: I was lucky, I just got beaten up, 2-3 times. |*| 8 | R: Well, yes, in this sense there was a COUNTRY 2 guy, we two  were punished. But there were also worse stories. A guy from CITY 1, kicked out from officers*| ´*|  school, not officers*| ´*|  school but military school. When you were kicked out from a military school, you were high in hierachy, but then it came out from somewhere, that he had been kicked out because of stealing some coats. It meant that in positioning, he was positioned the lowest. In the case of this man, it was shocking to look, how a nosy guy who did not obey officer*| ´*| s orders and so, turned into a special guy.

The environment was in this sense quite severe.(---) Neither Russian and  Estonian guys from COUNTRY 3 did not come along with each other. In the beginning there were 100, taken from COUNTRY 3 together, students from CITY 2, some Russian railway-school guys. There was no direct quarrel but neither love. The reasons for conflicts were different, the most important was that men were terrorized on the basis of how long you had been in the army, and the more important you were, the more you could afford it and the younger you were, the  more you had to serve others and bow.(---) |*| 10 | R:  Of course it has. (---) The main difference is that there is no COUNTRY 2-style terror. Naturally there are some conflicts, as men*| ´*| s background are different. They have collective punishment there, it means that if someone does not manage in something, the whole squad is been punished.(---) In general, there is less violence. |

Well, there is a qym in the INSTITUTION 1 and there they can go running or excercising, do other things. Even when you are in the same room with someone, it does not create the situation as it is in basketball, football, that you depend on what others do, and you can go this way and do the excercizes what others do, well that is different. Inevitably it is difficult for a women to play some games together with men, you have to be in a very good shape to play men over. There are very few of them who are equal in that. |*| 6 |  R: Yes, they would not capitalize in this way that from then on they are going to count on each other or make the decisions because of basketball. Rather it is as a background, additional  human value (...) It is not so decisive. Some things are going to work out differently. Basketball and football players have certain privileges before others. You would be elected, then members of other parties know you from football or basketball teams. |*| 8 | R: Yes (....) Well if you go somewhere in PLACE1 to play basketball, then on the return-trip home to have some drinks, make jokes, it does not mean at once that in law making procedures it is like that: a basket-ball team member made a proposal and his wish we will take seriously without deciding; things are done differently there. |

And it was common that the wives would be at home, a few of these would have a job. In case they had a job, then it was, how can you put this, the lower classes on society. Then they would be delivering newspapers in the morning, back then you didn’t have these boys delivering the newspapers, you had wives doing that.

Some things where practical tasks, where you think there is an imbalance (*| *| ) |*| *| ? |*| 13 | R: I would say a key word in this is probably what you refer to as ‘settling expectations’.  |*| 15 | R: And this happens everywhere, at work and privately, that you have some expectations and if these are not fulfilled then maybe you have to say both at work and privately*| *|  Well, that brings us to some of the more traditional roles for men and women. Where some traditional roles have been softened throughout the years and others are more permanent. |*| 17 | R: Well, what I understand about traditional things is that in 99 % of all cases, men have a more practical way of doing things and maintaining things around the house, car, bikes, in general. One can say that maintaining one or two cars requires that you have enough money to pay for taking the car to the car shop to have everything fixed. Which also means that you have to bring and pick up the car from the shop, but the woman has this thing that ‘the car is only for transport’.   |*| 19 | R: It just has to work and that shouldn’t be so difficult. Well, maybe not but you have to have it checked every year, you have to put summer tires on in the spring, you have to put winter tyres on in the winter and you need new windscreen wipers, you have to make sure there is enough sprinkler fluid on. In addition to that you need to vacuum it and wash it every second, third week or something like that. Because the woman wants it to be comfortable to sit in, the seat and the bottom should be clean and it should be too dirty on the outside. So really, if I think about this one, the third woman, well she like having a nice car that functioned.  |*| 21 | R: But the whole maintenance issue – no she couldn’t see any reason for her to do it because I was much better at that than she was. In fact she was right about that because I was, it was just because she wasn’t interested. Well, it was something difficult I did, she had no problems vacuuming in the house*| *|  |

And I have to say it was influenced by the fact that I was the youngest teacher and the rest, they were these old male elephants, right? And then in fact, there was one female teacher around 60 who left at the time, she quit. |*| 3 | R: No, in fact there was also a teacher working on an hourly basis and a few others. But this one had a permanent contract, and she even quit during a staff meeting. She felt like these old men were bullying her.  |*| 5 | R:And she mentioned that quite often. That it was these old men, all of them round 50-60 years old.  |*| 7 | R: Every time during the staff meeting she would start crying. So something must have been wrong, right? But it was always like she felt neglected by the other teachers and*| *|  There was a group of language teachers, I didn’t take part in that because I wasn’t teaching languages. But she had all those language classes. She always felt that she would have to stand next in line compared to those old men. And that was, on the hand they felt that they always had to take consideration of her because she didn’t like teaching in rooms where she could feel a draft and she was always used to teaching in the main building, not the huts. So it was all these small things, right?  |*| 9 | R: Yeah, who you would ask and those sort of things, right? But it wasn’t something I had a lot, well because I belonged to a different group of teachers and taught, of course it had an influence that she would quit, right? It was a big drama – she broke down in tears. And then, then we didn’t see her again, she choose early retirement in that connection.  |*| 11 | R: Yes, it was. She would constantly say it had something to do with gender. It was the men who wanted to take the decisions right and then she couldn’t handle that and those sorts of things.  |*| 12 | (*| *| ) |*| 14 | R: No, I didn’t and I think this gender engagement, I think it ended up being pathetic.  |*| 16 | R: Well, it*| *|  I don’t know, first of all I think it was a little childish when they disagreed on how the students should be divided. It were these educational things in relation to how you can teach languages and so on. And I felt that was odd, pulling a gender discussion into that. It seemed like some sort of card she would take out and then toss this one about sex discrimination out, right. And in relation to this discussion, I felt this seemed rather pathetic. On the other hand, I did also notice that these were some old male elephants she had to fight against. And in this respect, I would say that I had a more natural advantage in the staff room because after all I had been politically engaged and knew how to handle conflicts between persons and so on.  |

That the girls are only looked at because of their looks and so on, I think you can say that. (*| *| ) |*| 5 | R: No, it was mostly in the youth division. It’s because you had this more ‘bold’ atmosphere, right? The amount of these bold remarks coming from the guys, they probably pull in that direction, will degrade women’s professional capabilities, I think you can say that.  |*| 7 | R: Well, you sort of become a part of it, right? Yes, for example, a concrete example is that for example when you had to register for courses, right? So that was something I was responsible for, and for the registration you always notice how many girls there are and how many of these are good-looking, it was just something you noticed. And that was it, I don’t know, maybe the girls just did it in relation to which guys were good-looking, I just think it is more common for the men to do it.  |*| 9 | R: Yes, I think so. No question, there is.  |*| 11 | R: Well, I don’t know. It’s sort of the way you talk about how the girls look. It’s rather special in such a male dominated environment, right? It can easily become very cheerful right? (Smiles) Not now, something quite precisely, but rather who was good-looking and who was less good-looking. And those sort of things.  |*| 13 | R: Mmm, well, I sort of think that girls were a little socialised into this. Maybe in the way that they know their role in relation to, at least one girl she was very aware of her good looks. Which made her able to get certain things and so on, right? In fact that weren’t that many, I don’t think anyone felt offended about this. Because you couldn’t achieve anything by getting offended.  |*| 14 | (*| *| )  |*| 16 | R: I would say there are always these traditions which have survived and some terms we use, right? For example girls we would normally refer to these as ‘chicks’ right. And I still think a lot of them do that. Because I had some girls working in the office, right, and then they would be referred to as service chicks by the guys, right (smiles). And there something rather subversive about that term right? And I think such terms they will live on, right? That’s the way you used to refer to them and then you just continue regardless of the individual you’re thinking of and those sorts of things.  |

It is my responsibility to take care of the local organisations, how they interact with each other and how they interact with the national organisation. My experience has been that in the organisations where girls are in leading positions, it doesn’t even have to be as president. As long as there are some girls, it would be as vice president, this more or less takes over a natural division of things. In these organisations, I feel more confident that they can run the local organisation in the right way.  |*| 2 | (*| *| ) |*| 3 | There was also one in (name city2), she just left, that was running in an ok way, even though we did have a few problems with her. But now a man has taken over. Whenever I call him, I need to be more in control of everything than if I contact one of the organisations where there is a girl, then I feel*| *|  |*| 5 | R: Well, I sort of feel she is more in control of it. Well, she, maybe again it’s sort of the maternal role, right. She has control of the family, she has control of the organisation, she has control of all these things which makes everything run smoothly. But I don’t have to think about, at least not in an active way when I call up a boy.  |*| 6 | (*| *| )  |*| 7 | Generally, I just have, in these organisations I just have more trust in the way things are run when it’s sort of girls.  |*| 9 | R: Yes, it is. Generally more, reliability is simply the correct word in this connection and I also think it says something about this part of the dynamics, I need things to run in a reliable way as we talked about before. And as for the reliability, I have this prejudice that things will be like that once you get girls on board.  |*| 10 | (*| *| ) |*| 11 | If we have a committee where I am also a member then I won’t be able to do everything, what a surprise. Here we have chosen a girl, I chose one, because she was good at that and she will be taking the lead here. Then I know things will be done. We could also have chosen a boy who would may just sit around and do nothing, but there wasn’t one. Then we chose a called (name girl) who would sort of be leading the group. Then I am confident that the agenda will be sent out early enough, that whatever we discussed at the least meeting will be described in thorough way so we can recap the next time. I even asked her to write me a message from time till time if I don’t manage to do everything to the agreed deadline then I know she make sure to remind of the date.  |*| 13 | R: Remind me of the deadlines and so on, right*| *|  Then, then*| *|  again it is about this thing that if a girl is involved then it will be all right, then it will be all right. Instead if it were only boys,  if it were only boys then I would immediately say ‘well, I have to take control to get something to happen’, right. There is also a political committee where you have a boy leading this. I know him and that is part of the presidency. But again where you have girls and that is, yes, that works really well.  |

If you are in a boy's group there is always competition to get one or two girls in. And then in the second term we got two girls in the group, all together we were five persons. And for these girls, their intended role was to take on all the formalistic work. They had to be in charge of all of that, something which the rest of us didn’t care much about. Not because they are not talented, they are very talented at an analytical level. But these things about the size of a project, how to do your references, how to do your bibliography, when to hand it in, how it should look like.  Layout, everything, all those things.  |*| 2 | (*| *| ) |*| 4 | R: There was a change in roles. That often happens when you get to know each other more closely. Then you have finished some work and you know what each person is capable of. So there is a difference between the initial impression and perhaps the prejudices you have and until the persons actually prove their capabilities. And then the differences more or less stop because it just turned out that one was very skilled in keeping a good overview of everything and then she also proved to be very skilled in the analytic work. I also took on some of the more general work, including correcting commas and those sorts of things. Also and then the analytic parts – roles changed as we went along and one of the boys he didn’t do this or didn’t do that simply because we believed he wasn’t good enough. And it wasn’t because he’s a boy, it was because of his capabilities which just didn’t match.  |*| 5 | (*| *| ) |*| 7 | R: Yes, it did. It always means something. Especially when these individuals adopt a different role than was originally intended. Then something dynamic happens in the group. Initially you don’t really know each other but at least you have an idea of where you are and then you work your way into those roles where you would naturally be part of a group. In this respect, the girls then belonged to totally different categories.  |*| 9 | R: Well, one of the girls who has intended to take on this role of doing all the practical things, she was very good at that and of course she should be taking on all of that. One of the boys had also been intended to take on that role because he was good at writing all the general parts and keep an overview of things. And maybe not get so involved with all the analytical work but rather stand on the sideline in relation to the analytical work, he also got that role. And the one who was sidelined he was slowly pushed out, particularly because we would often gather all the work we had done and read through the work of the others in the group. Then we realised that he wasn’t just careless but that we were forced to constantly rewrite his work – it simply wasn’t good enough.  |*| 10 | And there was this girl, this other girl, she was really good, and the two of us teamed up when I realised she was very good at exactly the analytical parts. Particularly by taking a critical look on our own writings, right. And then it ended up being more the two of us who would be sort of leading the groups and taking us in the direction we wanted to go. In relation to (name fellow student) – he and I were meant to have done this. At least what was initially the plan.  |

But I haven’t been able to do that and neither in local*| *|  local government. Because that would take me too far away from my job and my husband and he wouldn’t accept that (speaks in a lower tone of voice). So I nearly got a seat there when I refused it. Because I knew our marriage wouldn’t last if I accepted the seat.   |*| 3 | R: In our local government. Because we are not that many in this area of my political observation which means you do not have that many candidates on the list.  |*| *|  |*| 7 | R: Yes. And my husband was also very kind and supported me at a time because he also joined the party. Because if there would ever be a point when there would be many candidates running. If he had to support me to get on the list to register for the local government, then he would. So that was*| *|  Well, it’s a bit up and down for him depending on how much work he has at the moment, right? So*| *|  |*| 9 | R: I always support him. I think so, he really does consider my wishes. Even when I tell him when there is something he really wants to do ‘go ahead’ and support him in everything, because*| *|  well, that’s just who I am. And in principle he does that but there is just a line. Ehh, for example during this term I am lay assessor and I cannot do that in the next term because you cannot be 70 years old. Not until the next term will end. Then I can’t do that again, so it has only been this term. Which he has been supportive of. But he is a little bit younger than me and I have been saying ’you should try that as well, you know what it means’. In this, I have convinced him to try something political, sort of political, right. Even though he wasn’t really initially interested ‘oh well, if you think so’.  |*| 11 | R: Yeah, yeah. In principle, yes. But I also see that it would be difficult for him to find the time. It’s not only the long working days, it’s also sometimes in the weekends and he also has to take care of the house and the garden (laughs).  |

And that made me think ‘that’s strange that they would mix something so personal into it. Because it hasn’t had any effect otherwise, well I had to take one day off because my child was feeling ill.  |*| 8 | R: Yes, well. Then I realised, I also started asking him several time. I have always been taught never to take no for an answer. At least not the first three-four times. You never know, you may be successful – it takes five to make up a statistic. Then I realised that our male trainee (name colleague2) – they were paying for his course. Me and (name colleague2) are they only trainees, at least as far as I know from my time in the business, who have expressed a wish to study at university. And then I asked (name colleague1) a bit ‘you’re studying as well, right?*| ´*|  Yeah, yeah he’s taking (name part time university course) ‘arhh, he did forget to show up for an exam’ and now he had to take a re-sit. He was a bit, well I don’t understand why he started studying in the first place because it doesn’t seem to interest him at all. I asked him ‘how can you afford it?’, ‘well, the company is paying for it’. ‘They are also paying for my books and so on’ and I just thought, well okay. |*| 10 | R: No. But our managing director likes him*| *|  And he doesn’t like me because I decided to have a baby two weeks after my trial period was over (laughs). And I have been saying this on numerous occasions there, to my nearest colleagues, that from a professional point of view it was like shooting myself in the foot to take (name step child) in, right? But of course, the authorities took him away from his mum and there was no question about this, he should not go back to her and of course he had to live with me.

One thing, I work as a bartender at a disco here in (name city1). I still work in this company. After having worked there for six months I had been promoted once and climbed up the career ladder there. I was the one that people would listen to and look to for inspiration. At some point new leaders were being appointed, one new bar leader was to be appointed. Which happened to be my colleague (name colleague1). And I was told that the reason why they choose (name colleague1) and not me, was because they had only had one other female leader at the mid level in 13 years and she didn’t do a very good job.  |*| 3 | R: Yes. It was, I got angry as hell! First I was so upset because I had work every single Friday and Saturday.

And yet it was some bloody other person who took it, just because his name is (name colleague1) and my name is (name respondent). Well, I was very, very upset.

Yeah, and in 13 years that had had one woman. There are four leaders working there every weekend, so maybe they have had 60 different leaders at the mid level in this place.

Well, if you were a woman, this was back in the days where the old grading system was used, you couldn’t get more than just a pass mark. That was just how it was, you couldn’t! Even though the external examinator would argue during the oral exam that you deserved a B then you would always get the pass mark because the teacher, because he simply wouldn’t have it. And then at university, one of my professors was the total opposite (laughs) – if you were a woman you would just get (raises her hand and points up to illustrate the high marks) then you didn’t have to do shit – you would just get really high marks. And if you were a guy, then you would get really low marks.  |*| 3 | R: Yes. And none of it was a good thing and none of it felt great. Well, I did think it was great that I received good marks at university (laughs). But I also recall, I think this must be because of my experience in high school, then basically I knew that it wasn’t great in any way.  |*| *|  |*| 5 | R: I actually filed a complaint against my teacher, I am ashamed to admit that I did not file a complaint against, I should have done that if my idealism was genuine then I should have filed a complaint against the teacher at university. But I didn’t. But I did actually file a complaint against my teacher in high school.  |*| 6 | (*| *| ) |*| 8 | R: Hell no, no one did that.  |*| 10 | R: Oh, yeah. It was a regular joke, that how it was. And it was just odd that the female students were always able to get extra assistance for papers and the male students they were left to sort everything out themselves. All the guidance they got was by e-mail and the rest of us always went up to his office, so*| *|  Well, you ought to have done something about it if you were an idealist, which I wasn’t*| *|   |

Because I participated in putting forward a proposal as vice president in (name youth organisation) one of my main priorities is gender equality so to say. In this connection we did a resolution on getting parental leave for fathers in the European Parliament, rather that you should be allowed to take parental leave in the European Parliament. At the moment you can’t do that so if you are a woman and goes on leave in the Parliament, your group will loose one vote. If you loose a case by one vote, this doesn’t exactly invite anyone to take parental leave at all because you always know who will be blamed for loosing a vote. This is also why you see many European parliamentarians taking their children with them to work. And when I put this story forward, I often experienced that folk they were sort of thinking that maybe it was because I was a woman that I would think like this. I tried to suggest that this may be more of a general attitude. That’s something I noticed in general that when you discuss gender equality*| *|  that many only see it as a female question – it’s only because you’re a woman that you care about this.  |*| 2 | (*| *| ) |*| 3 | And then generally in working life, I believe your gender matters. Well, at least what you are paid! How and which kind of work you get! If you can get a place on a board! Because I feel in comparison with Norway where it is mandatory in boards, well you can see that many Danish women have a place in boards in Norway.  This has something to do that we do actually have women who are qualified but they cannot find a place on the boards here. |*| 7 | R: Well, there I think I experienced it a bit. I think. But I believe that if I had run, then I would have won because I would have been able to gather enough votes. Because there were women positioned all over. Well*|

And to some, I even remember, I have participated in interviewing people for jobs – in these interviews we asked male applicants whether they would object to having female managers/bosses? |*| 5 | R: Yes in fact we did! One did that because there were young men who would have a hard time accepting that. So that thing, this little question about ‘what do you think, how would you feel about having female*| *| ?’ I suppose we were in the 70’s then.  |*| 6 | (*| *| ) |*| 8 |   |*| 9 | R: I have never heard, never gotten any negative replies. Then you may ask how objective that is when you are being interviewed for a job? |*| 10 |   |*| 12 | R: Yeah, you should probably ask that, right (laughs). |*| 13 |   |*| 15 | R: No.  |*| 16 | (*| *| )  |*| 17 | And that happened when (name managing director) came into the firm, the well-known (name managing director) he changed it from being an organisation that was about technology to an organisation that was about the market. And then the women sort of started to get a place.  |*| 19 | R: There were people with other educations which meant that people with a marketing background moved in. He would say ‘you need the technique, that has to be okay, there is no question about that, but it should not control the company’. You have something called customers and you have to remember that, you had sort of forgotten all about that during the growth period. Customers they were just always there.  |*| 21 | R: Yes. Now you had to do something for the customers and then you would change the business to be controlled by the market and this completely changed the management structure. And we got that, females were put in high position, even at the level of vice president. We did have women at that time so it was a very, a very interesting development. You would aim for, not only getting females, but also aim for female values in fact.  |*| 23 | R: Well, you would understand it like you act more according to intuition. Maybe not always according to logic, which may bring us back to the prejudices again. But there was something about it – women probably have, some natural ability, to sort of put emphasis on something else.  |

My point of view about the headscarf was pretty clear-cut, in that sense that, for me, there is no reason to hide, and the veil, the headscarf, implies to hide from men’s view. (...)

She had the custody for the four of us*| *| . And this feeling probably stemmed from this. But she wanted the custody, for her it was unimaginable to leave us to someone else’s custody. But at the same time, she experienced the difficulty of taking care of 4 children, almost uninterruptedly. (*| *| ) She was working half time, more or less. She kept the same patients (for her dental surgery), but she was only working part-time in the surgery next to the one of my father, who was working full time (*| *| ) She didn’t want to leave us too much with a nanny and she felt a bit invaded, professionally, because she couldn’t be all the time at the surgery, and my father was pinching some of her patients.  |*| 9 | (...) |*| 10 | R: (...)

I tried to have some distance with the vision that my mother had about men. While it is clear to me that I shouldn’t be sort of underrated or less considered than a man for being a woman (*| *| ), so maybe I tried to balance a little bit the fear she had about men, and this tendency to restrict men to “something” which is present only from time to time. (...) It’s important for me to build a family and a man and a woman are equally important, and their relations should be quite equal (*| *| ). It’s not that great to be separated, I guess.

He could have also taken all his vacations at once so that I would have been able to get back to work, or finding another nanny, but he did not. |*| 5 | (...) |*| 6 | R: Why me ? Why ME? Why should I be the one who put her carrier in brackets for my child? He (her son) is as much is child as mine and I consider that when my son is sick, that he has temperature, he knows as good as myself to take care of him. Therefore, I can also take a few days to stay at home. He thinks he is indispensable for his boss - but he’s not – while I MUST be available for my son. |*| 7 | (...) |*| 8 | R: Currently, I am looking for a new job. And the first thing I consider, is whether I would have to work on Saturdays, cause my husband works on Saturdays, so I tell to myself: ‘you don’t want a new job for having more trouble’. But finally, I should not ask myself this kind of questions. We should find a solution so that I could choose freely the job I am interested in. And not linking my family to my professional life. Especially since he does no effort for such conciliation. He never told me: ‘Let’s change, I will stop working on Saturdays and work on Mondays instead'. |*| 9 | (...) |*| 10 | R: In his family, the father is the pillar, and the mother – I will be nasty – the maid, since his father had a restaurant – which he recently sold – and his wife was restricted to the cash desk and the cleaning, and she wasn’t authorized to step the floor of the kitchen. So my partner always assumed, I guess, that men were kind of superior to women.  |*| 11 | (...) |*| 12 | R: He never talks with his mother. When he talks with her on phone, he asks for his father. He never asks her ‘what did you do today?’, but instead, he will talk for hours with his dad. He talked two minutes with his mother, and that’s was well enough. |

Dad is sick, he was diagnosed an amyotrophic lateral sclerosis in 1996, one year after the birth of my brother. That’s a degenerating disease so progressively, the state of his organism got worse until 2002. In 2002, after two years on a wheel chair, he died. And suddenly, I am the eldest of a family with 3 children and a very professionally active mother. (...) Of course, I have plenty of responsibilities over this period and paradoxically – that’s something that really hurts me – from 2000 onwards, my growth curve literally stops. I stop growing just when I am facing those responsibilities. It was kind of special, because at school, I was kind of shy, I had almost no friends, because of those responsibilities. The new boyfriend of my mother has two children and therefore, I have two other brother and sister (*| *| ) who lives with us on the weekend or every two weeks, so that during these weekend, I am the oldest, almost the father of 4 younger children. Moreover, there is a strange phenomenon occurring among the family of my father: there is a striking resemblance between me and my father. And of course, I bear his responsibilities upon my shoulders and each time we have some family dinner, that’s again “you look so much like him!’. During these moments, I can really feel that I am bearing the psychological legacy and the moral weight dad had in this family. |*| 3 | (...) |*| 4 | R: If I had a sister a bit older than me, I am not quite sure she would have had to bear the same weight and there is this resemblance that is so striking according to the whole family and that encourage everybody to see me as the new head of the household, whereas my mother endorsed a rather ambiguous role, if compared to the father’s role and the mother she used to be before this happened. |*| 5 | (...) |*| 6 | R: (...) And of course, it completely changed my relationship with my mum, because there was, of course, a kind of complicity, but also a kind of conflict, since we didn’t really know who should be the man, so to say. She was still my mother, though, but also my father, a bit. She was the one who had the authority, but as she was very active professionally (*| *| ), I was kind of obliged to assume the role of the father, which wouldn’t have been the case if I had been a girl, I guess. |

In 2009, I received my school leaving certificate with low marks, concluding quite low-profile secondary studies. But then I had a kind of revelation: I wanted to study political science (Sciences Po, a very selective academic curriculum in France). My model was the ex-boyfriend of my mother, who was a senior public officer and had told us a lot of stories about the Empire, and so on. Apart from his public career, he had a bookstore that sold classic books and therefore there was this kind of atmosphere floating around. And this idea to study political science. It was kind of a success, by the beginning (*| *| ) And a failure, by the end. So suddenly, the big question: \""what will I do?\"" And I finally opted to follow my father’s steps. I have been told: “you will study Law\"". |*| 3 | (...) |*| 4 | R: (...) Finally, perhaps it wasn’t such a great idea, because I failed too. And I think that in this case, the fact that I am a boy played a role. (*| *| ) Firstly, I had a true lack of sociability, since I could never blossom at the high school. So I tried to catch up. For the first time, I could join a group of friends (*| *| ). And then I discovered the parties, the girls. (*| *| ) I guess that after completing the secondary school, I tried to mature and that’s why I was so interested in girls: you try to grow up with them and for them, since seduction is only a mean to prove yourself you made it, you became a man. |*| 5 | (...) |*| 6 | R: (...) And it was also because of the models I had. As a model, I had – I guess (in sociology) we use to say the ‘groups of reference’, right? –  the group of students with whom I went to a lot of party, last year. They were very pretentious, they felt superior to girls – girls were mostly objects for them. We played a lot (with them)*| *|  and I never really succeeded to get accustomed to it, and it made me think further (*| *| ). If I do think about this, that’s true that these guys had no little sisters, no sister in general. And that’s make a difference, yes. |*| 7 | (...) |*| 8 | R: So I passed my exams at the end of the secondary, and it lasted about a year during which I have tried to discover myself, before I met my girlfriend in December, 2009. And that’s truly a big thing, we both believe in it and I do not frequent anymore the guys with whom I used to be. We are together for 18 months and (*| *| ) it really changed my vision of everything. I mean, I didn’t change only my sociability, but it also transformed my vision of my studies, of the family, of friendship. I am now spending much more time with my family. And I think*| *|  I am not sure a girl would need so much this kind a stabilizer (*| *| ). She went through the same ordeal like me, she lost her father and it seems to me that she built herself, just with her mother. She is the only child. She is a very though person and she definitely played the role of a model, for me (*| *| ). I have often the impression that I am filling a void and the same for me.

And this time I had asked for a kind of cuddly toy, a Kiki (*| *| ). This great little monkey, you know. (*| *| ) I open my birthday’s presents, and my mother brings this present to me, saying ‘the neighbor picked something out from your list’. And right at the moment when I unpacked the poppet, my grandmother said: “no doubt, he is gay”. |*| 3 | (...) |*| 4 | R: (...) And you discover that being a boy, it means you can’t play with dolls. What’s more, my grandmother lived in the countryside. I was a boy, which meant I should chop wood, gardening, fishing, whatever. A boy shouldn’t stand cooking*| *|  What an idea to like cooking pies and other stupid things like this! |*| 5 | (...) |*| 6 | R: (...) Story no 2, let’s bounce: 2 or 3 months ago. I rarely visit my nephew and my niece, but when I go to visit them, I take them in some of those big toyshops and there, let’s play to Santa Claus! Very interesting: my nephew, running around the shop – for my niece, it was that easy: ‘I want this’. Great. My nephew going around the shop for 20 minutes: Playmobil, Lego, radio-controlled cars, and so on. After 20 minutes, I feel his indecision and I ask him: ‘what do you really want?’ (In a low voice): ‘I would like the same as my sister: a doll’. 8 years old! |*| 7 | (...) |*| 8 | R: (...) We all question ourselves about our sexual orientation. We know that physically, we are all boys or girls (*| *| ). But what’s the decision I shall make with this? What’s my sex, actually? If I do like cooking and playing with dolls, am I a girl or a boy? Do I prefer boys? Am I homosexual or heterosexual? Later, when you’re a teenager, the question of this choice can still subsist. So all this surely left a mark. |*| 9 | (...) |*| 10 | R: (...) It must be really deeply anchored, really, if an 8 years old boy needs 20 minutes before he dares to say in a low voice, “uncle, I would like a doll”. Let’s imagine: the school, whatever, all of this which can contribute to the fact that this little boy (is afraid of asking for a doll). A precision: he has no father, he lives with two girls. So it’s pretty normal if he likes cooking, since he is surrounded by girls. He has nobody to play cars with, but his sister, eventually. I felt how uncertain he was, but finally, he came out: I want a doll. |

In this case, by the fact of being a man, there is a physical difference. Because in the case of an IVF, medical constraints are much differentiated for the man and the woman. (*| *| ) Last February, I realized something after the last IVF: things went really bad; a slaughter, my wife had an ectopic pregnancy, and had an operation*| *|  the really nasty thing. Psychological support for the woman in such a situation: 100%. Great follow up. Psychological support for the (man) : 0% (...). And I realized this also in February, for the sampling. We all arrive early in the morning for a sperm sampling, 5 guys in a row, we all know why we are here (*| *| ). We know it: we are here to jerk off, at 7.30 in the morning, and there is nobody around. And because I am kind of a chatterbox, I can’t help and I go for a chat with a nurse. (*| *| ) And she sees me arriving with a smile. ‘You look quite in a good mood’. ‘Well, I am not about to do the worse thing in life’. And she tells me: ‘you can’t imagine how many men are traumatized by this’. Who gonna talk with them? Who gonna take care of them? IVF is a female-dominant medical act. Motherhood, that’s still a women’s stuff. |*| 3 | (...) |*| 4 | R: (...) There is no doctor or paramedic who comes and asks you: ‘are you OK, Sir? How do YOU feel? (*| *| ) Don’t you bear it upon your shoulders too? (*| *| ) We don’t have all the injections (that women have), that’s true, all the physical dimension. But still, when you are fully engaged emotionally, I mean I am here, I do the injections, when the nurse cannot come. |*| 5 | (...) |*| 6 | R: And what about me ? I am not upset with my wife being for 3 days at the hospital? I am not upset to learn I won’t be a father? I am not fed up with all that story? And who has to manage the guilt to tell to my wife: “you know, I am 10 years older than you, perhaps it would be easier with someone else?” These are discussions that take place within the couple. And we all make the same diagnosis: IVF really affects couples. |*| 7 | (...) |*| 8 | R: But that’s the same with this: if you browse forums on the web, forums on IVF, gynecology, it’s like reading a men’s mechanics forum (*| *| ). If you read at the comments posted by those who go through an IVF, their guys are nothing but sperm donors. Them or a Danish student whom you would pay 2.000 euros, that’s all the same. When you read this, you feel a bit strange being a man. You simply don’t feel comfortable. I exaggerate a bit, but that’s the feeling you can have. |

And therefore, when my children were born, I was already working. And at this time, I remember we were entitled to take a 3 days leave for a child’s birth. Although I did not work for long as an employee – later I always ran my own businesses, I was an employee when my first child was born. So I took those three days, and passed those three days, I went back to work. (...) And I know it was really very, very strange and that not having this daily, permanent relationship with my children, made me feel a bit strange. My wife took care of them. At this time, she didn’t work and she kept upbringing our children at home until the second – I have two children – was 8. 8 or 9 years old. It was the choice we had made together, but if during these 8 or 9 years, I could have had the opportunity to have 6 months, 1 year perhaps or if my wife would have returned to work while I would have stayed at home for a while, I would have surely loved it. And it created, how would I say, it modifies completely the relationship between a man and his children, between a woman and her children. There are a lot of things which happen consecutively, like a chain-reaction, that make things really different. |*| 3 | (...) |*| 4 | R: (...) In a period (the 1980s), when there were a lot of discussions about gender equality – there are still much debates -, a time when people wanted the same rights for men and women, which I understand in a number of issues, I found it was a pity that men could not have this break to be present with their children. |*| 5 | (...) |*| 6 | R: If I could have taken a parental leave, I think that personally, I would have satisfied my*| *| , how would I say, the pleasure if was for me to stay with infants, because I always really enjoyed the fact to see them to awaken to new things, to evolve in their environment. You know, when kids are really young. And there is also this physical contact, this exclusive relationship that I find really moving and which I really felt when I was a young father. But when you leave to work at 6.45am – because we lived in Paris’ suburbs and you have to wake up really early to escape traffic jams – and when you come back, it’s late already. So when you leave at 7.30am and you come back at 8.30-9pm, you don’t see your kids, basically. |

They certainly do have the same skills as men, but I think it was mostly a family issue, and I didn’t see much evolution in this profession.

Yet, we never recruited homosexuals, because it was considered a weakness, you could become blackmailed, or something, you know, the Intelligence classics.

And I entered the technical school when I was 13-14 years old, therefore I wasn’t among those who already have a clear-cut idea of what they want to do. Thus I mostly followed my father’s recommendations – he was a technical worker, a machinist – and he had taught me quite a lot about his specialty. |*| 3 | (...) |*| 4 | R: (...) If I really think about it, I remember that my mother had a distinct point of view: she wanted me to go further with music, but it was already too late for the violin. I should have started much earlier. And I would have been much more interested to play violin, of course. But it was already late, and I would have hardly made a living of it. So my mother was kind of more inclined towards humanities – I also liked drawing, but finally, this option to enter the technical school came out rather incidentally (...). She thought (I had talent for playing violin), 'cause when my parents, and especially my mother, asked me:*| *| would you like to learn how to play violin?“, I was quite reluctant, and yet, something happened, don’t know why, she convinced me somehow, saying*| *| just let’s try it“. Perhaps she brought me to some concert – because we used to go to the theater and for concerts with my family. Anyway, I started to play violin, and I really enjoyed it. I really didn’t care about practicing all the time, I really found it enjoyable, when the fingers were finally finding the right position and that It played how it has to play. But still, it was to late to enter the conservatoire. |*| 5 | (...) |*| 6 | R: I realized that my eldest son didn’t stand about going out and playing with other kids, and that he preferred to stay at home and drawing all the time. And with some talent. So we decided with my wife, that the only best option for him would be to study some craft arts – he didn’t like maths at all -, so that he could make a living from it. We sort of encouraged him in that direction. And finally, it worked. |*| 7 | (...) |*| 9 | R: There was a real progress, of course. For instance, I do see a progress in the fact that my wife and myself, we tried to consider what (our children) wanted, actually. We both considered how to make things possible for them, how to give them advices... Whereas in my family, it was my father’s decision, we made it together (...).  |*| 10 | (...) |*| 11 | R: Because my father was terribly single-minded and he really stood for imposing his own views, including if everybody was against. And of course, this firstly applied to my mother. In that sense... I certainly did not have the best possible example, as regards the way to behave with respect to my spouse (...).  |*| 12 | (...) |*| 13 | R: The beginning (of his relationship with his wife) were pretty harsh. It took me some time after we got married and we founded a family (...) to realize that actually, I didn’t like the way my father did behave, and that it’s necessary and good to consider your partner as an equal. |

From 1978 onwards, I worked for a Western European company (specialized in technical medical supplies), for which I traveled all around the Czech lands and Slovakia over 20 years, until 2001, and for which I did a number of trainings to learn people how to use a number of technical instruments. At one moment, our chief of department died. |*| 3 | (...) |*| 4 | R: (...) And a woman was then hired in the company, who originally was a stock manager, with barely two years of business and management school as only background. Since there was nobody else, they hired her to organize and manage our service for a short period, but she eventually stayed until now, and she is still chief of our department.  |*| 5 | (...) |*| 6 | R: And I remember that it was problematic, because of course, there were many technical issues she did not understand, although she did it great otherwise. I know that on a few occasions, I had to calm down some of my colleagues, saying:*| *| Please, let’s explain this to her, and everything is going to be fine“, so we all learned to respect her (...). I don’t want to overrate myself, but I have been more like saying*| *| come on, that’s OK“, to bring (my colleagues) to the idea that if we do explain things, we will all have some peace, and everything will work fine. And I said:*| *| you don’t know by whom she would be replaced, it could be worse“. We even could make some benefit from the situation, because as a woman, there were a lot of things that she understood differently, like people’s needs and how to manage a situation... so we all came to that conclusion and it was really useful, I guess. In short: some school of life'. |

One of the first occasions when I felt I was a man was kind of funny. When I started to go for a beer with my father in our country house – because in Prague we never went to the pub – I realized that the guys who stood there were talking about their wives or women in general, with some sort of disdain. They were making fun of them, they didn’t show much respect and... I was 16, I was perhaps collecting firewood with my father and after one hour, I could drink a pint of draught beer, and it was the first time I noticed that I was really different from... those women. Because I had also noticed that neither my aunts, cousins nor (any female relatives) were talking so contemptuously about men like men did about women. |*| 3 | (...)  |*| 4 | R: (...) But in fact, I didn’t like that situation very much. I must say that... perhaps because I was interested in Arts or because I have never been a typical macho, but I felt it did not correspond to me. And I want to link it to the fact that at that time, I was already really sensitive to the relationships between my father and my mother (...) and I realized how much things my mother had to do when she returned from work and how much my father did. And I found this huge difference so incredible, that I tended to sympathize with her and to give her a hand (...). And soon after, when I was 18 or 19, I stopped to go to the pub with (my father and my brother) and I felt that this world of adult men who went there, wasn’t made for me. Since they couldn‘t talk too much about politics – it was dangerous at this time – they passed their frustrations onto their partners, their mothers, and women in general. |*| 5 | (...) |*| 6 | R: And that was the first occasion, when I told to myself that 'I would like to be different, completely different and that I would not behave that way‘. |

Even before I was 30 and especially since, I have friends who behave differently (from their fathers‘ generation), in a way which is, I would say, more appropriate to the 21st century, which means that they try to respect some balance as regards the house work. At least (they come to such a decision) when we talk about it or when they go on parental leave, as it was the case for many of them. Many of them also assisted to the birth of their children, something that my father’s generation did not, for instance – because here, it was usually impossible, you could not enter but anyway they wouldn’t have assisted, except those*| *| comrades“, maybe.  |*| 3 | (...) |*| 4 | R: (...) because it hurts me when someone (even if he is a friend whom you can forgive a lot of things) talks really contemptuously or pejoratively about his partner... or about women in general, I started to filter, rather unconsciously my friendships. It was not a plan nor a project but rather unintentionally, I have tended to focus on those friends whom I know they are the closest to me from this point of view. |*| 5 | (...) |*| 6 | R: (...) But at the same time, I am not so sure anymore, and in some aspects, I return to... – maybe because I am in my 40s... I will be 45 this year – I am less convinced about some of these judgments, because when we talk about this with some friends, I am not so sure anymore that this confusion between female and male roles is always a good thing. When men are often on parental leave because their wife are... better paid, that’s fine, that’s good, because they know it is something provisory that will change at some point – the man gets back to work and the woman stops working or something like that, but I think it can also have an impact... on the quality of the relationship, and I think that something of this traditional division of gendered roles, which is getting lost – in which men hunt and women keep the fire, and stay at home with the children (...), is really deeply rooted. And when it is completely reversed, turned upside down,  then it happens that people have to get back to it to some extent, to make possible for some sort of family, of social unit with children, to keep working. |*| 7 | (...) |*| 8 | R: (...) Yes, I have been on parental leave (literally:*| *| maternal leave‘ in Czech) and my best friend too, and I really enjoyed it. I would never change this and it was... it was great, one of the best moments of my life (...)‘. I think it is a fundamental experience, because as far as someone lives without children, with her partner, then most of life is just pleasant and nothing... there’s no obligation. But then with children, things change dramatically, and this service is -*| *| service‘, that’s an awful word, but that’s the correct one – is so demanding and has to be efficient. Then the classic role division between men and women is no longer valid, and it you have (...) to accompany them to the W.C, to give them a shower, to take their temperature, to take them to the doctor (...). |*| 9 | (...) |*| 10 | R (...) Women are paid worse than men are – even with similar positions, don’t know why, I miss the point. Maybe it is still the case because when they have a child and he is ill, then in most of the cases they are those who stay at home and take care of him. And that’s true also that in the Czech Republic there is no comprehensive day care system and if you are not lucky enough to have a grandma who is available, then it is usually the mother who cares for her child at home. |*| 11 | (...) |*| 12 | R: (...) I do have friends (...) women – some of them lawyers, whatever -, who are often extremely skillfull in their respective areas and who earn quite a lot of money. They can easily fulfill their needs, they have a high living standard, they can travel. But when they are alone, they have a number of problems to find a partner and if they are in couple, then after some years, this situation can bring small conflicts between the two partners. |*| 13 | (...) |*| 14 | R: (...) No extreme is good, however... Which means that the patriarchal model that survived here in Europe, till the end of the 20th century, including in this country at the moment – started to change in the past decades, to convert itself in something – I couldn’t say what – which makes at least possible a greater respect for women. And I would be glad if (my children) could understand this. |

It’s when my brother had huge problems with alcohol, when he was around 17, 18. He lived with my parents and so did I – because I was still studying – and his problems were so huge, that moneylenders came home from time to time to threaten physically my parents so that they would give the money my brother had borrowed from those guys.

I had learned this (traditional) perspective from my parents, from my brother*| *|  when I started to visit classes of French, where I met male and female professors. And two of them (female), called my attention, because their attitudes and their perspectives about life, were really to the opposite of what I had been used to, and to the conceptions I could have then about life and how everything works. |*| 3 | (...) |*| 4 | R: (...) In this context, my (conceptions) were put into perspective and I started to think a bit further. We talked about (gender relations) on a few occasions, they did kind of jokes, you know, about men’s weakness and so on, but although it was done with humor, it made me think a bit further. |*| 5 | (...) |*| 6 | R: Later, and that’s kind of funny, I decided to study at the Charles University, basically because there were a lot of cute girls. I don’t know if there was any serious reason, maybe there was. I say it as a joke, but to tell the truth, I guess it played quite a decisive role. I met my future wife at the University. She was especially fascinating to me because she’s a very strong personality, but at the same time she is very feminine. She is no tomboy or whatever, but she really stands for her own judgments and she has real problems to accept any kind of self-evident authority, which really fascinates me. If you don’t convince her, then there is no chance. It was the same with her professors, and with anybody else. |*| 7 | (...) |*| 8 | R: She can’t stand feminists, because she thinks they are much too aggressive, for instance those feminists we had around at the University, who always plan some kind of action which result to be funny. But it remains that I learned a lot from her, that I must reconsider a lot of things, cause so far, I had lived like the average Czech guy (*| *| ). In particular, I really integrated the fact not to consider anybody as inferior to myself, which is perhaps the most important. I learned it from my wife and I put it in practice, although it didn’t come from me, initially (*| *| ). Another thing regards the household and domestic works. We don’t have children, which surely changes a lot of things, but to take care of domestic issues seems quite natural and automatic to me. And another point is the respect we have for each other’s work, and the effort we make both to find some compromise. |*| 9 | (...) |

I find it really unbelievable (the survival of some stereotypes), especially when it comes to close friends.

We all laughed, of course, but still, it was for real. (*| *| ) |*| 3 | (...) |*| 4 | R: I think it’s a perfect illustration of the fact that although people now behave quite pragmatically (as far as gender relations are concerned), both in the professional and the social spheres, there are a few things that did not change that much, which I find fascinating. And this is one of those things. And it doesn’t matter if there are a lot of female politicians – which is also a nice issue in the Czech Republic, which can be summarized to the alternative between having just one or 3 1/2 women in politics -, or whether private relationships have changed or not*| *|  there are still things for which we really stayed kind of laggards. |*| 5 | (...) |*| 6 | R: We own a firm with my brother. From the professional point of view, we always succeed to find some compromise, be it as the result of, let’s say, ‘very dynamical discussions’, but still, that’s fine. Yet, when talking about women, we start to argue after 2 minutes, because our points of view are completely different. The best example is that he had to divorce because his wife wanted to work, and it was nothing like a big career, and his second wife, she didn’t ever consider this option. |*| 7 | (...) |*| 8 | R: (...) Higher education is key to understand (the differences with his brother), because it allows people to learn some reflexes and to think about these things. Whereas a guy who only studied until the end of the secondary school and started working, he has no idea about this. And of course, then he has no time to think further, because he must work and making money. Yet, we had the same education (at home) (*| *| ).  |*| 9 | (...) |*| 10 | R: (...) We had the example of a typical Czech couple, which means that my parents had both a job, while my father made most of the decisions. He made all the important decisions. It never happened that my mother realized something without previously obtaining my father’s agreement. My father was the head of the family, that’s all.  |*| 11 | (...) |*| 12 | R: (*| *| ) My mother comes from a very humble family, a workers’ family, actually, where the father was kind of an institution. They were four sisters and they had to serve him the soup first for dinner.

The last time it was in Turkey, for three weeks. Of course we had read before that since people are Muslim over there, it was sometimes difficult, let’s say problematic, for women to enter some buildings, and that (men) were more straightforward with European women. It was recommended not to leave girls alone and also to wear a ring, even for people who are not engaged. I bought some from a bric-a-brac trader in Berlin, where we transited, and we used to wear it in Turkey and it worked perfectly. (...) We went to some places where local women used to go out fully covered with a veil, and of course, my girlfriend was dressed in quite a Western style, or better said, Czech style: short skirts and t-shirts, and of course it called the attention (*| *| ). And although nobody told us anything, it was interesting to notice that those women looked at us very aggressively. I expected that it would be worse with men, those Turks, but on the contrary, they behaved very correctly, basically they didn’t even notice our presence and most of the signs of disapproval came from those women’s wrapped-faces. |*| 3 | (...) |*| 4 | R: (...)

I think it’s interesting how things are determined by our education. The way our parents expressed their feelings, how the behaved one towards the other, it somehow influences our (own) relationships. In my family, (my parents) always expressed their feelings, both mutually and to us, and it was kind of cheerful childhood, you know. And that’s still how it is: each time we see each other, we kiss each other, and we talk freely about any personal experience. |*| 3 | (...) |*| 4 | R: My family works along a rather traditional pattern, I guess: my father goes working and my mum takes care to maintain this cosiness, and to make the house clean and welcoming for us. And my father respects her a lot for that, I mean there is nothing unequal in this relationship, in that sense that he would say something like ‘I am the one who pay, so I decide’, definitely not. I think it’s quite balanced and*| *|  it seems to me that (this relationship) perfectly works and that’s just perfect. |*| 5 | (...) |*| 6 | R: Yet, when I met my girlfriend, I was a bit surprised that she didn’t much express her feelings*| *| (*| *| ). Afterwards, when I visit her at her (parent’s) place and I met her parents, then I realized that it surely stems from this (environment). I never saw her parents to behave differently than two cohabiting people. |*| 7 | (...) |*| 8 | R: Her father often leaves for business trips and her mother is kind of bitter, rancorous, so (for my girlfriend), that’s quite normal. And it was kind of interesting that when I told her that I will teach her how (to express her feelings), it didn’t work. Cause that’s a real problem, I mean she has this deep inside, and when she comes back home, she can’t tell or explain anything, she hardly reveal the way she is thinking*| *|  simply because they never told about (personal) things at home. |*| 9 | (...) |*| 10 | R: (...) So that’s surely comes from her surroundings. So I do see the example in my own family – although there are a few things I would do differently but still, that’s an example for me – and then I see her family like the complete opposite. Because I really don’t appreciate (how they behave), that’s so obvious they always had these problems but they just ignored it, simply because they were supposed to have children. I see it as completely pointless, such relationships shouldn’t exist. |

I support this because the Greens really support greater flexibility in terms of work-family reconciliation, with the possibility to work part-time. |*| 6 | (...) |*| 7 | R: (...) For me, staying at home was a kind of value, and I see as an advantage that I had this opportunity. Yet I know there are still some stereotypes at stake, which make more usual for mothers than fathers to opt for this possibility. But for instance, at my work place, there is this example of a man who goes on parental leave, because the mother is the breadwinner, so they decided that it would be much more convenient if she keeps working while he stays at home (*| *| ). Actually, I see that this trend to create more flexible working conditions is growing, especially among the youngest generation, in order to make it compatible with a family. If people can organize themselves and if that’s enough to make a living, than it’s the perfect combination (*| *| ). From the gender point of view, I think it’s positive’.  |*| 8 | (...) |*| 9 | R: (...) There is still a big difference between men and women, in politics. Politics is really nasty here and although I have only an experience at the local and the regional level, which is quite distinct from parliamentary politics*| *|  I would say that it’s still more complicated for a woman to gain respect and to be taken seriously (*| *| ). Look at the Prague municipal council or the government, there is no woman. And it is much related to the fact that these executives result from male-dominated coalitions. In that sense, the Greens are surely kind of an exception, because they have these gender quotas (strict parity) which makes compulsory to monitor the representation of both sexes on candidate lists and also for any decision-making position. So women surely achieved a different position that in other parties, and I think it has been one of the main contributions of the Greens, to destroy the stereotypes to which bigger parties were used. |*| 10 | (...) |*| 11 | R: (...) I am currently politically active at the local level. It’s really interesting, because the local level works quite differently, and I think that it does offer a chance for women from every political party, because they are more present at the local level. |

One of women’s advantages (over men) is that they can decide how long they want to stay at home with their children. Although I always tried to be emancipated, I deliberately wanted to live this period with my children. I have stayed at home 7 years with them. For long, I have thus adapted my workload (to that situation) and in general, I think it was fine, I like to remember this period, and I am conscious that for men, this option is rather complicated (*| *| ). And of course, this choice can’t be made by every woman, because they need to have a man who is able to make it possible financially, being the main breadwinner. We had that chance, and I think it was good, because nowadays, when (women) return to their occupation when their babies are only a few months old, I think it somewhat impoverishes the parents’. |*| 3 | (...) |*| 4 | R: When became a mother (in the late period of the communist regime), it was pretty common to become parents at 24-25. I was 24 and my partner was 25 when we had our first child. Today, that’s not common anymore (*| *| ). As women, it happened that after studying, we tried some activity and soon we had a child. But the fact we didn’t really start a professional career did not mean we were making any sacrifice, because we already had this feeling of self-realization’. (...) These 7 years I spent with my children also worked as a period for questioning what I really wanted to do of my life. So when*| *|  I look back to this period, I see this chain of events, the way it happened, as one of my real chances. |*| 5 | (...) |*| 6 | R: As regards sexual, or gender inequalities, when I think about these roles, I guess that this relationship, I mean these different roles of mothers and fathers towards children, is something important. A mother cannot replace a father and a father cannot substitute a mother. For me this is one of the most important differences. Because from the biological point of view, something slightly different is expected from each parent, and both roles are important. Whereas I believe that we could easily dismiss this differentiation between men and women in many other areas, in this case, I think it is a meaningful difference. |

That’s a Czech specificity: we have both female and male tenses and since this female form does exist in Czech for a specific working position or activity, I think that it should be used. So I did refuse to sign this contract, and I must say that those women at the human resources’ department, were quite astonished, because I convinced them with factual arguments, that they had to rewrite this contract, so that it would correctly refer to my working position. |*| 2 | (...) |*| 3 | R: (...) It appeared to me inadequate and I think that beyond, there are still some surviving old habits from the Austro-Hungarian Empire, according to which the position of women stem from the position of their husbands. This has to be changed, starting with small details, such as my job contract’. |*| 4 | (...) |*| 5 | R: (...) I think that under communism, equal opportunities between men and women were advocated through the opportunity for women to exert the same professions as men (*| *| ) and I think it was more respected, but possibly not (*| *| ) Although I grew up under the communist regime, I was only 16 when it fell apart, and I did not have any professional experience under this regime. |*| 6 | (...) |*| 7 | R: I choose to be a social worker, that is, from the beginning, a female domain (*| *| ). And today that I am teaching, there are 30 girls and perhaps 1, 2 guys in the classroom. It is also about how to secure a future, as regards the financial aspect. If we want to keep the traditional male-breadwinner model, with the wife taking care of children at home, then we must admit that a man can’t secure the income of a household. |*| 9 | R: This also about stereotypes: women are more socially aware, do better understand children, are better social workers than men. I don’t think so, but I do think that already when they opt for a future job, people must consider whether they can make a living from it or not. |*| 10 | (...) |*| 11 | R: (...) When I discuss with my daughters’ friends – she is 20 -, I realize they are looking for boyfriends who will be able to secure the main household’s income, while they will be working to buy shoes, bags, etc. Thus, even if things have changed tremendously, it remains that women is usually not considered the breadwinner, as far as it is a classic family, with a man. |*| 12 | (...) |*| 13 | R: (...) (In the Czech Republic), a large proportion of women do consider that actually, working or not is a matter of choice. Because under the communist regime, working was COMPULSORY. No other option was left, then. My mother could not opt to stay at home with us, and the financial situation was such that she stayed at home with me 3 months – the government did not pay for longer – my father was working till 4pm, he came back home and then my mother was leaving till 2am. She arrived at 3am, slept until 7am, 8am and then started to take care of us until my father came home. |*| 14 | (...) |*| 15 | R: If I think about it, about the difference between my mother's life, mine and the one of my daughter, I would say that's the possibility to make choices. I can decide whether I will do this, or this or this, and if I will do it in the Czech Republic, in England or in the United States. If I decide to start a completely different career, I can. Next year, I could be accountant - I am really bad at mathematics, but let's do it. I can be gold trader or building houses, whatever. I don't think my mother could have made such choices. |

(In the women’s rights organization I joined), we were mostly oriented towards assistance for victims of domestic violence. And while working for this organization and for its project of Legal aid, I realized how unjust is our juridical system and how women unfriendly it is, even if generally speaking, those cases, just as family and children issues in general, are judged mostly by female magistrates. I mean, I wouldn’t like to influence them, but I think that being women, they should better understand what’s the women’s position here and instead, I witnessed situations in which a man stay in flat for which her wife is still paying the mortgage, whereas she is living in a shelter (for victims of domestic violence), and the court takes perhaps 3, 4 or 5 years to make a decision.  |*| 8 | (...) |*| 9 | R: (...) Since, the legislation has changed, and we have now the possibility to expel the perpetrator from the house – but since here, nothing it’s really done in accordance with the Law or the rules, then it happens quite often that the perpetrator returns to his place and becomes even more violent with her partner, because she dared to let him being expelled and she dared*| *|  to defend herself. It was sometimes really difficult for me to follow these individual fates (*| *| ) Sometimes, the worse was the reaction of the Police, when (the victim) called the Police and policemen negotiated with the perpetrator, maintaining a kind of “man-to-man” dialogue (*| *| ). Of course, there was no record for this kind of intervention, because for the policeman, having a man-to-man talk was enough. I could hardly imagine breaking the traffic law, and then having a “woman-to-woman” talk with a female police officer who would let me go saying that next time, she will fine me. |*| 10 | R: (*| *| ) I do believe that women have to benefit from the same opportunities as men, and that those opportunities shall not be determined by gender, but by individual skills.

When your promotion and grading year arrives, you get the position because it is according to the years of service. (*| *| ) There are more headmistresses than headmasters. Generally, the army is discrimination*| *|  as I said not because women do not serve in the army. Now a law passed that gives men 2 extra points for promotions for the 2 years they served in the army and this mitigates the injustice in a great deal. Because now they count 102 points instead of 100 for the promotion and this makes a big difference.  |*| 15 | (...) |*| 16 | R: Equality has a lot of variables. As far as it concerns professional career I agree. But you cannot have equality in all domains. If a man travelling can hold 2 suitcases, he should not expect a woman to carry a suitcase of 40 kilos! This is not equality. This is a matter of courtesy. Men should be polite. First of all, equality must exist in professions but there should be mutual respect.  This means to respect the other according to their existence. It is not acceptable for a man to walk 10 steps forward and the wife and children to follow, like in old times. Or it is not right to say the man can go out and have fun and the woman should stay and do the housework and raise the children. Even in the area of relationships, men used to be free in having relationships with women whereas it was not easy for a woman to have a relationship if not married. In my view this depends on how the person feels. If he/she feels that they found their other half ok. But I would not judge a woman who had a couple of relationships before getting married.  If it happens, it happens. The same goes for men. There should be mutual respect and love between the couple. After marriage I cannot forgive cheating. It is lack of respect and love. It is better to say that you cannot be with the other person, whether you are a woman or a man. Both men and women can be free in this respect but always having mutual respect.  (...) |

But I would never say to my daughter, ‘because you are a girl you cannot be a pilot, because it is for men’.

Especially my mother, not my father*| *|  she used to beat me because(*| *| ) My sister and I were pretty much the same age. We always did all the naughty stuff together. We had some sort of alliance, a party. But at the end of the day I was the one who got physically punished because I was the boy, the strongest one. They thought that I would not get hurt, that I am stronger because I am a boy. In one case I remember we were little, 5-6 years old. Both my mother and father were away from the house working and we decided to do wall painting. We wanted to use mud. We used to read books about cave men and we just wanted to play. So we made the mud and we created art*| *|  you can imagine. As soon as my mother came home she didn’t even say anything else but my name.

My parents believe that boys are stronger by nature. Both physically and psychologically and I think that they beat me up in order to intimidate my sister.  |*| 4 | (...) |*| 5 | R: Since I was a teenager(*| *| ) I can tell you a story about going out. For me things were different. I was free. My sister was not. For instance when I was 15, the first time I wanted to go out, my sister was 16. I went to my father and said that I wanted to go out. It was not a school night. He said 'ok son'. He gave me money and asked when I was coming home. I said 'I don’t know' and he said 'ok, 01:30 be home'. Then my sister wanted to go out too. And they had an argument, because he said no. At the end he said that she could go out as long as she was with me and he told me to look after her. As if I were her father. I had to escort her whereas I could go alone with my friends. And when I became 18, I never told him when I was coming home. I used to tell him not to wait for me and I left. If my sister said something like this I don’t know what would have happened. She would get locked in her room. Unless she was with me and even then, they told me to bring her back at 12:30 and then I could go anywhere I like. Even though she was older she was not so free in leisure activities.   |*| 6 | (...) |*| 7 | R: It is like that for women generally. The woman is for the house. To do the housework, look after the children, to be nice and not to be criticised, to have a good reputation (*| *| ) Whereas boys, if they go around with one girl and then with another, my mother didn’t like that, but my father, my uncle etc they thought that it was an achievement, I was their favourite son.  |*| 8 | (...) |*| 9 |*| É*| : Whereas a woman is(*| *| )  |*| 10 | R: She is convicted by the society.  |*| 11 |*| É*| : By men, women or both??  |*| 12 | R: In my family, for my town she would be considered a prostitute.

In a village people would say it to ones face.   |*| 15 | (...) |*| 16 | R: The responsibilities(*| *| ) I always had the responsibility to look after my sisters but also to go to work with my father. He has his own shop and 95% of the times he needs help, he asks me or my brother. Even if it is not a difficult job for women.  |*| 17 | (...) |*| 18 | R: My mother does the housework. My older sister used to help but not anymore. She doesn’t live with us but even when she visits she does nothing. My mother always tells her “when are you going to become a good housewife you have to learn to do the housework because you will have to be in charge of your own house”. It is her destination to get married and until last year she was pressurised a lot and then my mother and her had a big argument.  |*| 19 | (...) |*| 20 | R: They don’t pressurise me.

We all have to follow, both boys and girls and we do not have a choice. My brother reacts often and I react sometimes because we are boys and he may listen to us. He used to listen to my sister too but he never really took it seriously. He always said that she is a woman. He used to tease her but he never listened to her.   |*| 24 | (...) |*| 25 | R: I used to admire my father when I was young. Then I grew up and understood than men and women should be equal. It was a mistake*| *|  In my opinion, men do not have to sleep with a lot of women. It is the same for women. It is their right if they wish to do it I do not applaud or criticise it. They also have common responsibility in the housework. My father would not even put his plate in the sink. Yes. My mother does everything. He can do the garden because it is a man’s job. The ironing, dusting, moping is for women. The heavy stuff is for men. He would never expect my mother to change a bulb. He underestimates her, he is scared that she might get electrocuted because she is a woman and she doesn’t know. (...) Whereas men know by nature. If I ask him about a male job he teases me in saying that I am a woman and I don’t know? Women are weak in his eyes.  |*| 26 | (...) |*| 27 | R: Church is a big issue. I feel that our religion is discriminating. They encourage discrimination between men and women. It is simple: only men can enter the holy place, in the Old Testament, the woman persuaded the man to eat the apple, to commit the sin and this shows me that women are nasty and cunning and when I was little I could not understand why women were so cunning and evil! (*| *| ) Also another issue is the fact that women must sit behind men so that men are not teased. The rituals are all performed by boys. All these for a very religious person, for a child or for my family are important and they promote discrimination.   |*| 28 | (...) |*| 29 | R: The army in Cyprus is a discrimination against men and it is a fact that men have to serve the army when they turn 18, for two years. I do not oppose to the purpose of the army, but this means that we lose 2 years of our life! The girls in our class go straight to study and they graduate by the time we start our second year. They can be out in the job market sooner and this means that girls my age now have job! And a job that I could have tried to get is already taken. This takes you back 2 years.  (...) |

We usually discuss some grievances. At his university, a polytechnic university, he felt many times that himself and the other male students have been discriminated against. They treat female and male students differently. Many times during exams where 95% of the students are male, and girls are a minority, during the exam, many times girls can ask a question and the professors or their assistants help them.

It was a great concern(*| *| ) I was initially employed at a large company and it was a great success for me but within a month I had realised that I was far away from my children and if something happened, the distance would pose a problem.

After a year of being in that job and after I had new colleagues and managers, a managerial position was open and I tried to gain this position, after 2 years where they had seen my abilities, and I got the position of the service manager. I had to advice customers and also to assign work to the mechanic technicians at the garage. I was in charge of about 10 technicians and I had to be in constant communication with the other manager.  Hence, I think that it was my success but also the fact that those men were open-minded enough to accept me(*| *| ) and my managers who were men(*| *| ) people of old age and lower education. At first I was treated with suspicion(*| *| ) I was not in charge and suddenly I had to be the manager. In great astonishment I admit that I had no problems. In comparison to people of higher education I am surprised that people of lower education can finally accept a woman easier in an equal stand.

I had this before. I had strong opposition from women who used to work with me. They just cannot accept it easily. It is easier for women to be persuaded by male managers and they like to question female ones, not openly of course. Women act in a cunning, indirect way. They like to gossip and act as if they are weak and they need help. |*| 6 | (...)  |

My mother was quite independent for her time, taking into consideration that she worked for the British Basis. So I had some advanced experiences for my time without saying that there was no control generally in the family. But, I had no serious discrimination in comparison to my brother, who is 5 years older than me. The only discrimination came from my grandmother, the older generation. She thought that my brother could be outside the house and play anywhere, whereas I had to be at home with her, as I was a girl. But other than that, I never had trouble at school, from my teachers, my parents(*| *| ) Even if I had strong views, even political views that were against the will of my father, even then I never experienced a serious problem.  |*| 2 | (...) |*| 3 | R: There was cooperation and seeing many couples of my age now, I honestly understand how progressive was my family and I am impressed. For the time being there was incredible cooperation. Ok in some matters of the house, although older people were negative in helping out, I remember my father always to have helped out. Although he was a traditional man from the village, he was interested in helping. And this did not leave space for discrimination in their roles.  |*| 4 | (*| *| ) |*| 5 | R: Of course I must say that life had it this way for me(*| *| ) I got married and very soon I was pregnant so(*| *| ) inevitably you have to enter into the role of the woman, to give priority to your family and your child and so at that time I myself was acting against myself, because of my gender. I had my child as a priority and this could not cope with the career.  |*| 6 | (...) |*| 7 | R: It was because of my nature as a woman. Because until then I had a very strong character and then I just lost my “orientation”, the motherhood instinct took over me. My priorities had changed totally and this is the case up to this date.  |*| 8 | (...) |*| 9 | R: Women should understand that they have equal rights and to take it as granted.

Starting from the part about media, we can look at it as food for thought. In the Cypriot TV it is easier to see women presenters in certain shows in the afternoon, in the morning but you almost never see a woman covering political stories or serious political shows. Even in the newspapers the journalists who write about politics or economics are usually men in their majority.  |*| 2 | (...) |*| 3 | R: When referring to the church, I think the church is discrimination by itself one way or the other, because of its structure. The structure and principles of the church exclude women from certain things; the basic one being that women cannot become priests. I think they can become nuns or marry a priest. Church creates division.  |*| 4 | (...) |*| 5 | R: Now about internet and the virtual society(*| *| ) The way women are generally presented or promoted in shows, in the extent in which women themselves underestimate their existence. Looking at the commercials about pornographic material and the sexual phone calls, this means that some women consider themselves to be “sexual instruments for men or women”. In my view this is very bad for a woman. In the beginning this could have been connected to oppression or need for work, just like prostitution but now I think that some women chose to do it. Without even realising that their choice undervalues their existence. (...) |

At my previous employment, I worked for equality issues, I had to investigate a complaint and ask the opinions of a mayor and members of the council about a case which was submitted to the Ombudswoman. This complaint concerned a woman who claimed to have missed a promotion because of her gender. When I went to see them, although they had been informed in writing, they were very surprised to see a young woman working for the state.  Their negative attitude was a combination mostly of the facts that I was a woman and that I was young. The important thing was that I was representative of the government and they were 5 men above the age of 50-55 and I had to sit and talk with them. Their age was important because it is at this age where men underestimate women the most, in my view. I was there for about an hour and they were clearly questioning whatever I said until I proved my point and even then they did not stop questioning me because in their mind they understood that I did not apply the law correctly in this case.  |*| 2 | (...) |*| 3 | R: This is what they were used to. All these years, men took over the managerial positions in the public service and they were used to this logic, without knowing if a woman can actually respond to these duties. And they were simply justifying their view, if they wanted to justify, in the case where the woman was at an age where she could get pregnant that she might get pregnant and have low productivity(*| *| )  |*| 4 | R: They don’t write it down but many of them say it. And some new employees experience this, too. They ask you if you think about getting pregnant or having a family*| *|  and there are instances where the answer was positive, they got rejected, maybe not by default but it was taken into consideration.  |*| 5 | (...) |*| 6 | R: The council was within the town. And this had happened before when I went to a private company and I had a meeting with the Director and his lawyer, who was again in the age group of 50 plus. He started questioning me straight away claiming that I was not in a position to tell him or understand the law and its application. And this has to do with the fact that I am a woman because he did not know my educational and professional background. So he did not know if I were a lawyer. At least it appeared as if I was the combination of the young woman again.  The most important part of injustice in the treatment of women was the part of complaints due to firing pregnant women (*| *| )  |*| 7 | R: The attitude of men over 50 who might be used to their wives or mother to be a housewife, so this is what they expect from younger women*| *|  they don’t trust them, they do not expect them to have a saying or to express generally, they expect them not to take part in the basic thing in a family according to them, which is the economic contribution. |*| 8 | (...) |*| 9 | R: The other problem in Cyprus is the parental leave. The father or the mother both have the opportunity to take up to 13 weeks leave from work. If we do not consider the fact that it is generally unknown, practice shows that mostly women take parental leave first of all because it is unpaid, and of course because they can combine it with motherhood leave and it makes sense for the mother to stay with the child.

Ok, in some situations I felt that my father was in charge. Just like for example(*| *| ) when they got married they went to choose the furniture for their bedroom. They were between two. My father then asked my mother which one she liked best. So she said the one on the left but my father then turned to the saleslady and said we will have the one on the right!  This is because my father already liked the one on the right and he just asked to see whether my mother agreed with his choice.  |*| 12 |*| É*| : And this period was only after the wedding(*| *| ) How was it afterwards?  |*| 13 | R: Ok the truth is that my father does whatever he wants.

But this means that my mother got hurt a number of times from this situation.  |*| 14 | (...) |*| 15 | R: Nevertheless, my father is very open-minded. He never made us feel inferior. For example whenever we went for a trip we always had to carry our suitcases. He wouldn’t do it because he is the man.

Whereas with my second sister and me, it was different (*| *| ) they were more relaxed, for leisure activities.

I know a case where the husband would beat his wife up constantly and his children as well. Usually the first person who receives violence is the woman. On the contrary, men are sometimes the victims of psychological violence from their wives. Sometimes women shout until what they want is done (*| *| ). And in this way the husband is abused.  |*| 20 | (...) |*| 21 | R: Indeed a lot has changed(*| *| ) Women are now equal to men, at least in our age.

There are women who take advantage of this and go a bit further. Sometimes they leave it all to the husband and he becomes the woman of the past. There are cases where the husband takes over the house. Especially now with the recession, when some men lost their jobs, the wife is bringing money at home and the husband does the cleaning and looks after the children. I know one or two cases.

I guess his mother always satisfied every need or want when he was younger and he was always her favourite, although she has another son. He was the spoiled one.   |*| 9 |*| É*| : So, you believe that, in this case, the role of the mother influenced the views of her son?  |*| 10 | R: Maybe because when he saw his mother do the cooking, putting his socks on perhaps (laughter) (*| *| ) When she never asked him to do something on his own and she always does it for him, then he learned that this is his role: to order and women will do as he pleased. Of course now that he has a relationship I think he started to change(*| *| ) although he says he believes the same things, in his actions he seems to have changed his mind. One time we saw him mobbing (*| *| ) it was a great shock! But his girlfriend was around and he was helping her. In the past, he used to sit on the couch and expect everything to be done by women.  |*| 11 | (...) |*| 12 | R: I get a little bit angry with the church. For example, we say that Jesus preached about gender equality. He cut Adam’s side and created Eva, so that they would be equal. He had not created her from the head to be superior or from the feet to be inferior. Nevertheless, we see things that show inequality in church. For example, men sit in front and women at the back of the church. Women cannot enter the holy room. I just can’t understand it; and when I asked my religious studies teacher at school to tell me why, she could not provide an answer. Or, for example, a woman is considered dirty and cannot receive the Holy Communion or worship the icons (*| *| ) when she has her period. What does that mean? It is normal to have that! (*| *| ) In Cyprus it is important because people believe. They go to church and the church has an important part even in politics, state affairs and has great power. Church is everywhere. The first president of Cyprus was the Archbishop!  |*| 13 | (...) |*| 14 | R: Due to the important role of our church in the society, if we start dividing men and women then this inequality is transferred to the society. And this is why in the work place men are advanced easier. The patent is transferred from childhood to adulthood.  |*| 15 | (...) |*| 16 | R: I think people our age do not think like this. Seeing what church is doing they started to disobey.   |*| 17 | (...) |*| 18 | R: Usually it is women who judge other women. Men consider this differently. Whereas if a man does something similar like adding a provocative picture online I don’t think that it will be commented, so much. So I see discrimination.  |*| 19 | (...) |

My parents, I would say, for as long as I can remember, have matched the traditional roles of what it is to be a man and a woman. Traditionally not in the sense of archaic, but in the sense that my father has always been the one at home on whose physical strength we have depended, to fix things that get broken, that was the order somehow, to take care of things, to keep the house in good shape. And my mother, purely in terms of the housework, was always the one who was cooking for all, or at least until we learnt ourselves, has used the washing machine, and so on.  |*| 3 | (*| *| ) |*| 4 | R: Also, my father, at least at first sight, was the person who was sustaining the family , but this has changed at times, there were periods when my mother’s job was the one bringing the money in the family, so that it exists normally. And there is this concept that my father is the person at home who is earning the money for us, and in a sense, my parents have even argued on this topic because there is the feeling that my father did not always want to admit, not in front of somebody, but in front of himself, that my mother’s efforts have been crucial at times for the smooth functioning of our home. And yes, it is interesting because they have quarrels on this topic and in a sense, my mother demonstrates more power, power in the sense that she managed both to take care of the housework and all the things that I enumerated, but also worked in the same time and made enough money in the period when my father could not make enough, so she made enough money to sustain the family. |*| 5 | (*| *| ) |*| 6 | R: But in a sense, I have been able to see that my mother does what she says and I have wondered why my father is so stubborn to admit it and to admit it to her, her merit, her efforts, that she really put into the family, at least in my eyes. |*| 7 | (*| *| ) |*| 8 | R: In a sense, I am used to this differentiation between male and female roles, and in a larger context, let’s say, although my mother has taught me how to cook, in reality I have never cooked for myself systematically and from time to time I realize that this would be a problem when I live alone or with somebody else. And this is linked to the role of the woman as the one who has to take care to feed the family, and I realize very clearly that this should not be this way, and also, I see that a big part of the women and girls around me, at my age, cannot cook, so if there are two of us who cannot cook, it is going to be interesting*| *|  (laughter). And I think that there are other things, although my parents have never, they have been distant when it comes to the topics of genders and sexuality and so on. Sometimes I think that it would have been much better if we had spoken about some things more openly, I think that they had left us to deal with this on our own and to learn the things, but on the other hand, they have never set criteria for our relationships with people, for our intimate relations, and they have rarely shown approval or disapproval, and they left us to make our choices and to live through the things that we have chosen.  |

The situation I remembered, but it’s not the only one, is when I was in the mountains hiking last summer, and there was a slope which was especially tough, and my advantage being a man then was that I managed to go up very fast, faster than most of the people in the group. I left my backpack on the top and I went down to get some other people’s backpacks, actually, I took the baggage of one girl and I went up with it. And of course, this is a very limited notion of what is male and female, but it is a starting point because the genders are mostly defined by the starting point, which is the body. When we start from the bodies, the first difference is the external one, that is, the external difference in the shape, in the body shape. And of course, it is debatable if it is a physical advantage, but this is a part of what makes a person a man or a woman, this is very conditional, but let’s say that in our culture, in the West, this is in a way the image of the man, who is physically strong. But nowadays somehow this is changing, this is not necessarily a sign of what it means to be a man. Or maybe in a sense, it is falling off. And of course, not to forget, the purely physical strength is not necessarily a part of the, so to say, identity, that is, the power of the body can be a part of having a male body, but does not necessarily mean that this person builds his identity precisely on this quality, that he turns it, in some sense, in the thing that defines his gender.  |*| 3 | (*| *| ) |*| 4 | R: In a sense yes, in the sport that I practice, in Capoeira, which is a type of martial art. The first thing there is that it seems dominated by men. The second thing is that, in a way, it is an advantage to be a man because it really requires a lot from the physical body, from the physical strength, high level of physical control, but also in the actual nature of the practice. I don’t say that necessarily*| *|  and there are many women who are very good, and I don’t say that it is necessarily an advantage, but having in mind it is very dominated by men, it appears to be an advantage. On the other hand, there are many things that I find hard to do as a man, but they are*| *|  specific movements, say, stretching and so on, and with them it is systematically observed that women find them easier. So, it depends what movements we are talking about. |*| 5 | (*| *| ) |*| 6 | R: And especially with the introduction of many different martial arts and other activities in the Western culture, and dances, these borders are becoming blurred and for example, men practice things that used to be seen as very female, dances, and so on, while women practice Capoeira, and they both do great, both men and women.    |*| 7 | (*| *| ) |*| 8 | R: But in the Capoeira itself, there are differentiations on the basis of the skills, and it has not been once or twice that I have been beaten up by a woman. And then I cannot feel equal because she has tricked me, she has tripped me or surprised me, or something like that. On the other hand, the opposite has happened as well, so in this sense, the equality of the skills does not exist, since every person develops individually. I perceive absolutely all people who practice Capoeira as equal to me, just because our skills do not depend necessarily on the bodies we have but more on the dedication we have, if we are dedicated to what we do, how much time we spend doing it, whether we take care of ourselves outside Capoeira, and so on, not only on whether one is a man or a woman.  |

My entering the aviation was by chance. In high school, there were these so-called school committees. A military duty had come to direct the better-performing students, so that they would become army officers. At first I was thinking, I could not become an officer. My father had died during the war, my mother and my brother were still alive. And I was thinking, these were difficult years, it was hard to make a living. After some hesitation, I agreed to go to a military school.   |*| 3 | (*| *| ) |*| 4 | R: And the gender, how to say, the gender – this is nature, it is given; and if we consider which gender is better suited for which profession, it is hard to define this because we know now that both men and women become good doctors. The same is in aviation, there were many good men aviators, and not that good, as well as women, there were a couple of very good female aviators. Although there was some underestimation, a woman, that is, the weak gender. But I have to tell you that women are more analytical, more thoughtful, that’s how it seems to me, not only in aviation but in life.

One woman, (Name2), she had connections I think, she graduated with perfect grade, but she died very young from cancer. All the rest were included in the aviation, especially in the light aircrafts. While for the destroyer aircrafts, there were only men. The work there is much heavier than in the transport aviation. |*| 11 | (*| *| ) |*| 12 | R: And she (a colleague), as far as I understood from my colleague on the flight, I don’t know where they were, but a passenger wanted to talk to the captain of the flight. And they were very surprised when the captain of the flight turned out to be a woman. This is how it was not accepted then that a woman can fly with 100 people in the plane, that the captain is a woman and the second pilot is a man. And now we know from the 1950s that there are even women on spacecrafts, the first one, Tereshkova, after that many Americans, but many died in the Shuttle crashes.  |*| 13 | (*| *| ) |*| 14 | R: So women proved that even in the toughest professions they are equal.

There were some people who were showing a condescending attitude towards the weaker gender, but I don’t know, I don’t understand this “weaker gender,” I don’t perceive women as the weaker gender, I think that all is equal.  |*| 17 | (*| *| ) |*| 19 | R: Maybe, maybe, because in these years, it was mostly men who entered these military schools, and the army. And now later, there are professional women as well. Now the army is becoming professional, before it was by recruitment. And now it is professional, like any other profession, there are many women and in the movies, and I also saw in the world, American women wear the same camouflage clothes as men do. So I think that it is almost equal now, you cannot say if a profession is typically male or female. Of course, the man is physically stronger, if something heavy has to be lifted, but I see that women also lift heavy things, they started fighting, on their level of course*| *|         |

Later on, I got to know that he had a lover, one of my friends, and I said I didn’t want this woman around. And before that he had already tried beating me up, once, in the very beginning. But then I had told him that if he would hit me even once, even if we have not one, but 101 children, I would divorce him. And I said this already in the beginning of our marriage. Then we had split for a bit, after that we got together again, and so on.  |*| 3 | (*| *| ) |*| 5 | (*| *| ) |*| 6 | R: We continued to live together for 10 years afterwards.

But then I said to myself, this is not normal, somebody beats me up and*| *|  |*| 15 | (*| *| ) |*| 16 | R: That is how they taught us.

If he beats you up, it’s normal, you are guilty for something and that’s it. And you have to agree with this, that is how they taught us. |*| 25 | R: When I passed out and I don’t remember how my ex-husband beat me up, my instinct for self-preservation became strong.

There had to be 8 months before my next university application. So I had to be a turner in a factory, you know. I said, this is a male profession, I am a woman, I would not be working as a turner. And the job of a turner, when you sit down, oil leaks on your legs, you know? I had only perfect grades in school, I was the Komsomol (Young Communist Party) secretary for three years, and in the end, what – to be a turner!   |*| 5 | (*| *| ) |*| *|  (laughter), to be putting screws on the conveyor belt, this and that, relays, all that, to put them together quickly.

I got a divorce in an easier way because I am a woman, and he had beaten me up, so I got a medical certificate, applied for a divorce, and after three months, I was happily divorced.   |

And everything was going according to this scheme until I graduated from high school. My sister always paid more attention to her appearance, she was more of a cute girl; I was always more negligee, androgynous even, it is just that some things didn’t come naturally to me. But when I told my parents that I am bisexual, it turned out that I am their biggest disappointment and that they actually did have expectations, which you don’t need to voice out – to get married, to have kids and so on, the kind of expectations that society has for you, that is, there is not even the need to voice them as expectations because they are more or less clear, and if you don’t meet these expectations, they are extremely disappointed and*| *|  |*| 4 | R: The first thing is that I am gay. My parents compared it to something egoistical, unmoral and not right. For example, like if my mother liked another man and went to live with him instead of staying with her family. Like, you start from a very egoistical point of view instead of doing what is best for everybody. And in the moment I wanted to be out, they said I am discrediting them in some way. They felt uncomfortable and said that it is bad for the whole family. Because they do not understand why if you are bisexual and have the option to lead a “normal” life, you would choose to be with a woman, like in my case.  |*| 5 | (*| *| ) |*| 6 | R: They were very explicit that it should remain a secret, that I should not tell anybody, that society treats people who are like that in a bad way. I accepted this for a couple of hours, but then I decided that I don’t want to be vulnerable with something like that. So I decided to approach the matter in the opposite manner – I would be out and*| *|  proud (laughter). It would not be my dirty secret, it would be something everybody knows and would not be “wow” information if somebody knows it. |*| 7 | (*| *| ) |*| 8 | R: Maybe they (her parents) are not informed well enough, and they think that all kind of LGBT information is some kind of propaganda. And maybe the reason is that until ’89 or ’94, only then they said that homosexuality is not a disease. And maybe they are influenced by that because they have lived most of their lives with this information.  |*| 9 | (*| *| ) |*| 10 |     |*| 11 | R: My mother became very sensitive whether I call them or not, whether I am interested in them. She was much more alert about all my actions and about all situations in which something does not happen like she expects, so that she can somehow justify to herself her expectations that I have changed and that I am not a good daughter in some way. She does that so that she can increase or justify her disappointment.  |*| 12 | (*| *| ) |*| 13 | R: And then she (her mother) held me accountable for going to a family gathering with a sports sweatshirt, and she told me this shows disrespect, since everybody had tried to look good, and I have gone there dressed as somebody who lives on the street, or going to do sports or something*| *|  |*| 14 | (*| *| ) |*| 15 | R: But it is more likely that this moment for them (her parents) embodied all these “See now, I knew it, I told you so,” a proof for all of that, but I don’t think this is directly linked to my gender. And I cannot imagine the male equivalent. If I was a boy, and I went to the family gathering in my sports sweatshirt, it’s not the same, it’s just that I have gone with a bit more sporty style. |*| 16 | (*| *| ) |*| 17 | R: Very often I think that people see me mainly as gay (as her main characteristic). |*| 18 | (*| *| ) |*| 19 | R: For example, my sister doesn’t understand why I look in an androgynous way. She says, “You don’t look like a girl with this hairstyle,” she absolutely does not comprehend.

But as outer appearance, as a way of dressing, behavior, she is more feminine, with long hair, she wears rings, all these details. She just doesn’t understand me. Maybe her environment is like that, they work with the stereotypes, they establish them in an even stronger manner among themselves, and this is the way for them to prove themselves as well. And nobody goes out of the stereotypes, nobody goes above them. |*| 22 | (*| *| ) |*| 23 | R: She (her sister) has told me that she loves me “even though,” the connotation is “even though,” I mean, she is ok, “I love you whatever you are.” Even though you are like that, I still*|

And during the whole trip in the train, these people were strongly intrigued by the fact that I am with short hair and could not hide their amazement. |*| 3 | (*| *| ) |*| 4 | R: They were a mother with three daughters, they were all with long hair, they were not dressed in a “wow” way, but were very feminine. While I was wearing a t-shirt that could be worn by both a girl and a boy, all my clothes were like that, and on top of that, I had short hair. And this seemed to shock them the most. |*| 5 | (*| *| ) |*| 6 | R: I felt very bad a couple of weeks ago, I was going by (place1) and some girls, who were in high school or something like that, they passed by and said, “was that a girl or a boy?” These are not people who live in the countryside, they match some models of course, but they don’t live in the cowsheds, so that they haven’t seen anything*| *|  you know, they are better informed and they live in a big city, but nevertheless, they could not react at all.  |*| 7 | (*| *| ) |*| 8 | R: When I was little, my parents just chose this haircut for me. It was not a conscious choice on my part. When they thought that I was a boy when I was little, I accepted this because almost every girl with a hat looks like a boy. And now I have chosen to look in this confusing way. When I look in the mirror, I don’t see a girl, but I don’t aim to see a man either, I am searching for an androgynous look and I like it and I feel good in it. It is not a question of being an embodiment of femininity. And I am fine to bear the consequences of such a reaction by people, by somebody who cannot read it and has not seen too many androgynous people around. For such people, it is confusing and not wrong, but somehow weird, like they meet some kind of a freak. |*| 10 | R: Maybe because they were raised in a patriarchal society in which*| *|  I don’t know if it comes precisely from the patriarchal, but the women wear high heels, they have long hair, which should be loose because if it is in a pony tail, you already lose points. If you are not wearing high heels, but you have more elegant shoes, this is fine, but the more you go to the sport style and you don’t emphasize the sexual appeal, which underlines your gender, the less you are evaluated in society in some way. Society requires it and imposes it. Even if you look good, you take care of yourself and so on, without emphasizing on your breasts with a low neck and all, never mind how big your breasts are, it is not ok because the expectation is just like that.  |*| 11 | (*| *| ) |*| 12 | R: I think that people who do not try to prove their masculinity, but more like*| *|  They show it very naturally with their actions like (name2) for example. They are very masculine, they do not try to prove themselves, that they are men, in the sense that, here, I will show you with this action now, they are rather calm, and they don’t worry if somebody tells them they are feminine because they are not in a defensive position from which to attack. For them this battle does not exist, and they go with the flow, they act naturally, and the result is masculine, and you feel them like really masculine men, not like*| *|  This is not based on the muscles they have and how they have dressed and things like that. |*| 14 | R: Because society links masculinity with such outer characteristics – muscles, a wide back and a short haircut, specific accessories – such a belt, a watch. For men it is very important, when they compare their watches, it is like they measure how big their penis is, for example. It depends on the context, but in the business context, they check each other’s ties and watches and they judge on this basis how successful and masculine the other is.  |*| 15 | (*| *| ) |*| 17 | (*| *| ) |*| 18 | R: I know that somehow since I was little, I felt good when I was not looking precisely like a little girl, but something different. But I can never be a boy, this way or the other.  |*| 19 | (*| *| ) |*| 20 | R: If we transfer the situation symmetrically, then I would be a boy who looks in a feminine way, which would be stranger in people’s eyes than a girl who is not wearing nail polish, make-up, in most cases people just think that I am a boy and do not understand they are mistaken, and this is a very big difference. One day in the subway, I was with my headphones and you could not see my earrings. And you could not judge by any detail that I am a girl, nothing external, except if you don’t recognize the features of the face, just like that, if you look with your peripheral vision, but you don’t register it as strange information. And one day I had put both a diadem and the headphones, and there was one girl who could not stop looking at me. She was wondering, she could not stop wondering and she was very confused. I was also wearing mascara then. And I think that she was seeing a boy who had put a diadem and mascara. Since I was wearing a jacket, no other gender details could be seen.  |*| 21 | (*| *| ) |*| 22 | R: If I am a girl who does not wear nail polish, visually this is not as “wow” as a man who wears nail polish.      |

I have played a lot with him, I taught him how to play chess, how to ride a bike, to draw, there was even an old guitar of mine that he was trying to play. Even when he was older, 10 years old, we used to play basketball, to play in the sport school next to home. It was very pleasant for me to spend time with him when he was little, when he was a kid, but it was interesting for me, on the other hand, that his mother did not have any interest to deal with him. It was just not very pleasant for her.  |*| 3 | (*| *| )  |*| 4 | R: It is unusual if we keep in mind that children's teachers are mostly women, in the kindergartens, 100% are women and that is why this is different, it shows to a certain extent that there is no strict separation who should deal with the children, who should teach them and take care that they develop in this way. |*| 5 | (*| *| )  |*| 6 | R: So the standard situations (at home) are, naturally in the house work – cleaning, cooking and even in the cleaning, I was taking a big part, if we have to break the stereotype, but in the other things – cooking, washing, other house work, my wife was dealing with them. |*| 7 | (*| *| ) |*| 8 | R: Well, it affected me as it affects anybody else (the divorce), it is a psychological turmoil and does not affect people well*| *|  The change in this sense did not affect my life that well, but in the same time, as a man it has not affected me that seriously, to say that it has been a big, fatal stress. |*| 9 | (*| *| ) |*| 10 | R: When my wife was unemployed, then from a financial point of view, there was a bigger dependence. |*| 11 | (*| *| ) |*| 12 | R: Especially in cases of repairs at home, furnishing, repairs, in this sense, when we had to change the floors, to paint the walls, in this sense.

In the interview that took place at the workplace, the employer was interested whether the person who would work for him has both the physical capability and the qualification, whether the person would be able to cope with the work. And the work of a vet is harder – physical strength is needed, not only knowledge. And among the three candidates, the man was chosen – that was me. So in this situation, it was not about experience and qualification, it was more about whether the person can cope with the work, the way the work is.  |*| 3 | (*| *| ) |*| 4 | R: Such things happen often when it comes to practical work with animals. It depends on the situation. There are places where the work is not that heavy, in pharmacies, where things are not directly linked to working with animals, like veterinary specialists. |*| 6 | R: This is fair as the person, the women, who have applied for such a job, they would not feel comfortable in such a job because it is quite heavy. It would not be very convenient for them, although they could possibly manage, of course this is strictly personal, everybody can judge for themselves. But if we are thinking in principle, it is not fair.  |*| 7 | (*| *| ) |*| 8 | R: There were other competitions done by the Higher Veterinary Institute, for assistants’ positions, the case there was completely the opposite. Women were preferred in most cases in these competitions, rather than men.  |*| 10 | R: On the basis of the fact that they fit better the positions of teachers, so they are more suitable in this situation. |*| 12 | R: Because they are, maybe, more patient in such situations, in the teaching professions.  |*| 13 | (*| *| ) |*| 14 | R: Maybe it is a male profession (veterinary medicine), most of the time.  |*| 16 | R: Because of the people who are attracted to it – yes. But things change with the years, and things are not that differentiated between men and women because there are many women in the clinics that work with small animals. There is more balance already.  |*| 18 | R: This is due to the fact that people have equal capabilities that are not affected by their gender. |*| 20 | R: Yes, only in the last 10 years. |*| 21 | (*| *| ) |*| 22 | R: I don’t feel at an advantage (because he is a man), but there have been situations in which being a man gave me better chances to get a job done. |*| 23 | (*| *| ) |*| 24 | R: The conclusion is that the veterinary medicine profession can be the same for men and women. In principle, everybody can do the job, but now things are more equal because there are more and more women in the profession, even in the veterinary institutes women are predominant; in the last years there are more women in these institutes. It is not like 15 years ago, it is different, things are becoming equal.  |

So we saw some gypsies, and she went to them and asked them where the block that we were looking for was, and they started explaining some things amongst themselves. Then one of them came, obviously the oldest of them and the leader. He came straight to me and explained to me what she had asked them. Obviously he thought we could settle it “like men,” he did not trust that she could understand him, so he came to me to explain to me where the block was, and I had no initiative to talk to him in the first place. |*| 3 | (*| *| ) |*| 4 | R: In their case (gypsies), women are, women are only for making children and for taking care of the children, they do not even count them as people. And they transfer this attitude to other women, who are not their women, they transfer it, and for them there is no point to explain to a woman, as she would not understand. For gypsies, I think, this is a standard situation, but it was funny, because I don’t communicate that much with such people and I could not understand the situation initially.  |

It turned out that the field is dominated by women. For example, there were only 5 to 10% of men there, I cannot count precisely. And with time, most of the boys gave up and moved elsewhere. The only boys left were some who were very talkative and sharp-tongued, some who were more open than me. And the rest were only girls. And I have noticed that it is mostly like that in the Humanities in education. I don’t know if this is due to the fact that more women choose to study for higher education, and men try something else, or because men emigrate in an easier way, I don’t have any clue to be honest, but definitely this is the case everywhere, this is my impression, in the Humanities field. But recently I heard, I have heard often about girls who study Pneumatics and Hydraulics in the Technical University, and I would have never thought that there is even one girl there. |*| 3 | (*| *| ) |*| 4 | R: I was never good at mathematics, that is why my only option for education in a Bulgarian university were the Humanities. In this field, you could be accepted in the University only with Bulgarian language and literature exam, or English exam. I guess that this is the reason, I cannot say for sure. I always thought that it would be very interesting (his University education), but honestly, it was not that interesting. But for the girls it was very interesting. They managed to find something interesting in the field, something that made them work and discover new things*| *|  they have always had a stronger motivation, maybe because they find more interesting the relations between people, like in this field of studies, more interesting than men find it, I don’t know. |*| 6 | R: Yes, because after all, they (women) find these things interesting*| *|  it is the same with psychology, things like emotions, relations between people*| *|  I don’t know, that is how I see it at least.  |*| 7 | (*| *| ) |*| 8 | R: I don’t agree with what is usually accepted about women, that they cannot do this, that they are not fit for that, or for the other thing. There are many examples that this is not true, for example in the case of driving. Of course, I was more tolerant before, but then I started noticing myself that whenever there is a strange occurrence on the road, in 90% of cases, it is women. But this is my observation; I don’t think there is a definite reason for that. Yes, I don’t share the opinion of a friend of mine who says that women should not have driving licenses at all, and he says that in a very serious manner.  |*| 9 | .      |

He travels often and does not have much time, but he also absolutely refuses to deal with such things, so in the end, this is completely my mother’s job.  |*| 3 | (*| *| ) |*| 4 | R: But after all, there are some things that are a “male job,” so to say, which require more strength, more work with mechanics. And my father, he can change a light bulb, but he cannot do anything more than that. And this according to me, I evaluate it as something not that nice. |*| 5 | (*| *| ) |*| 6 | R: Because he (his father) has always refused with such hatred, not only refusing, but also getting annoyed with these things, I don’t know, maybe he has left me with such a bad impression from the whole deal. I do not like his approach, I cannot say that he does not fulfill his obligations as a person who makes the money for the family. Although my mother also works, but he is more important in this respect and he always shows off with this. This is also something that I don’t like, but this is not that important. |*| 7 | (*| *| ) |*| 8 | R: To some extent, I don’t believe that they (the obligations of men and of women) should be that separated. And to have things like “a woman’s job” and “a man’s job.” I don’t think it should be so*| *|  Like it was with my grandmother and grandfather. With them everything was very strict in the very standard way, the patriarchal model. My grandfather was always doing the things that require more strength, the mechanical work; my grandmother was cooking, cleaning. He was never dealing with these things – cooking, washing the dishes, this is very standard for the old times. For example, I can say now that I try to do some of the things, which used to be seen as typically female tasks and I also expect that the woman I live with would do some of the other things, as much as it is possible. Not to have things separated according to this principle, that it is simply a man’s job and that’s that, or that it is a female’s job. I do not see this as very practical. But specifically because of my father’s case, I try to learn as much as possible about the things he had not taught me, just because he did not deal with them, he could not do, but I try after all*| *|  I think that to a certain extent it is expected of me, but I also see it as more fulfilling to be able to do these things (typically male jobs). |*| 9 | (*| *| ) |*| 10 | R: Women had fewer rights. But I think this comes from the time when there was a stronger discrimination towards women, even from the time when they could not vote. This was not such a long time ago, it was when they were young (his grandparents). I suppose this continued in later years, everybody had strictly defined obligations. The man had to protect the house and the family from enemies, but the woman had to take care of the children and the food. And nowadays, I think that the roles have blended a bit. We hear more and more about men who take care of the children, they take*| *|  actually they have the right of two weeks of paternity leave. Yes, absolutely, it is not too long though*| *|  So it is not considered strange or something bad if the man stays at home and takes care of the housework and the woman makes the money. Although for many people this could be a problem with their pride and self-confidence. Just because this old model is still so strong. |*| 11 | (*| *| ) |*| 12 | R: That is why for him (his father) number one stimulus in his life, number one aim has been to have enough money to take care of his family, and he has always insisted on this and has been very proud that he ensures a nice life for his family. And in some ways, he is not ashamed that such simple things are so foreign to him, some repairs for the car, the house, such things. But he is not ashamed, he just compensates with the pride that he makes money for the family and that he is doing well.  |*| 13 | (*| *| ) |*| 14 | R: Not that she (his mother) is masculine or something like that, she just has to do it, when a person has to do it, she learns. She had to learn to do many things.  |*| 15 | (*| *| ) |*| 16 | R: She (his mother) is an engineer, she does not work with her hands, she works in an office with people and with a computer. She does not do physical labor, she is not a person with rough hands, who works with his hands.  |*| 17 | (*| *| ) |*| 18 | R: Actually we (he and his sister) are closer to my mother because we have spent more time with her. My father is a bit*| *|  he takes care of the more pragmatic things, and the conversations with him are always a bit boring. So we have always been closer to my mother. We have always seen better her point of view, and maybe this has created a bit of a negative attitude towards this aspect of my father’s behavior. |*| 19 | (*| *| ) |*| 20 | R: I notice that other fathers have taught them some things. But he (my father) never had the instruments, he never dealt with such things. And I have tried in recent years, not always, I have the interest to do some things by myself, to cope by myself in some situations.   |*| 21 | (*| *| ) |*| 22 | R: This standard comes from the time when women were totally discriminated and were doing what their men told them, the man was the leading in the family. The whole initiative came from him and everything more important came from him, and they only took care of the warmth in the home. But in two sentences, in some ways, I think that some of these things should be kept, but there should not be such a strict differentiation between the activities of men and women. If somebody can do something, let them try it and do it, and not only because this is a man’s job or a woman’s job, so it should be done by the respective person. I think that this model should be changed a bit, but some of the activities require, for example, male strength, so some things cannot be*| *|  But I don’t think that there should be a strict differentiation just on the basis of old patriarchal values.   |

We started living in an apartment with the mother and father of my husband, and his sister as well, and this meant already six people in one apartment.  |*| 3 | (*| *| )  |*| 4 | R: And when I saw that my husband finds it very hard to separate from his mother, from his family, and maybe he did not dare to make the step, he was not sure that he could manage to have his own family, to deal with the new in his life, he just remained in the old place, he just decided to stay in his old home. We lived together. But I saw that I am the stronger of the two and that I can do more and from then on*| *|  I started fighting with life.  |*| 5 | (*| *| ) |*| 6 | R: I have always felt that I am the strong one in the family, that I was the one who can say “This is what we should do now, we have to go there and there, we have to do this.” And one of the most important things for us was the upbringing of the children. We wanted our children to see as much as possible from life abroad. To see the difference. And we travelled a lot. I wanted the kids to travel as well.  |*| 7 | (*| *| ) |*| 8 | R: Because two generations cannot live in one house. Old and young people cannot live together in any case. |*| 9 | (*| *| ) |*| 10 | R: I tell you, I have not seen this from anybody. There was just something in me that kept telling me that I have to go out, that I have to drag the family onwards. Maybe this is because I had already seen what it is outside of Bulgaria. And I have tried in some ways to introduce this in my family as a way of life. |*| 11 | (*| *| ) |*| 13 | R: Yes, definitely, yes. It has influenced how I am. I am happy about this. For the simple reason that when the Perestroyka (the end of Communism) came in Bulgaria, and when everything went upside down, when there were no jobs for people like me, above 50 years old*| *|  then I went to America. I started learning English when I was 55 years old, so that I can go out, so that I can work abroad. And I went there. Then I came back, and because I decided I have to work closer to home, I started learning Italian, so that I can go and work in Italy. Just because there was no job for me in Bulgaria. |*| 14 | (*| *| ) |*| 15 | R: Women in Bulgaria show much more initiative than men. They are the part of the family that pulls the family ahead, the part which is more progressive, for me, definitely. I see that my daughter (Name1) is like that as well.  |

Because you cannot share this with everybody. Neither with your family, and I was married, right, you cannot share it in the family. Nor with a friend, or a colleague*| *|  you cannot share this.

This was another moment in my life where I had to figure it out myself, but I do not think I managed fully, or at least it took me a long time. |*| 3 | (...) |*| 4 | R: At one point, all my girl friends started having their first period, but I was still not getting mine. Meanwhile I watched one episode of ER (Emergency Room), which was telling the story of a little girl, who was having an operation, and they found out that she had testicles, which are inside, not outside. And then in some way, my lack of sexual education and my feeling that I am different attached me to this image and I was completely obsessed and I decided that I have the same problem. (*| *| ) Because for me this was the most horrible thing in the world – to be NOT normal – to be a girl, but not quite. After that, I got my first period. |*| 5 | (...) |*| 6 | R: And I was thinking that actually it is not normal to be aroused by such things, that it is not normal to watch porn, that only boys do this. And again, I entered some kind of a stereotype. Because my mother had never told me anything, nothing about the physical aspects of the female body in its worst details. Not worst, but, yes, in its details. I had never seen another naked woman and how it all looks like and in some way this also confused me and I could not create a clear idea of what I was.  |*| 7 | (...) |*| 8 | R: And in some way, this whole story has gone really deep in my subconscious because for many years, I have been telling people “I am a man,” and even now, I continue saying it when we are with boys and they say something like “you would not understand this joke” or that women are stupid and do not have sense of humor, then I don’t say “this is not true, women have a sense of humor,” but I say instead, “but I am a man and I have a sense of humor and I am a man and I am brave.” For a very long time, I kept seeing myself as a boy on many levels, even when I was writing short stories, I was always writing from a male point of view, which can be also normal for writers, to want to be in the other position, but is also strange in some way.  |*| 9 | (...) |*| 10 | R:*| *| it may sound very cheap, but in a way, when I say “society” I mean everything that covers us daily, all that we see, the things that we read, all that is around us. |*| 11 | (...) |*| 12 | R: For example, from kindergarten to my 12-13th year, I had a best friend. I liked spending my time at her place. She had a big family. She had a smaller brother, 3-4 years younger. Her mother and father worked in the same firm. Her grandmother and grandfather also lived with them and were working with them. They had a house with a dog. And they travelled a lot. They went to Disneyland, and I remember I was very jealous then. And in some way, every time that I was at her place, I felt calm, they always treated me with nice food, there were always toys*| *|  |*| 13 | (...) |*| 14 | R: So if we accept the male and female bodies as the metaphor for the way in which things happen with the man and the woman*| *|  for the man, his sexual organs are outside – it is clear, it is outside, it is outside him, which he can see every day. The sexual organs of the woman are inside, you cannot see what is there. You can do some exercise and get there, but you cannot really understand, and I guess there is a taboo about this thing. I don’t feel that I have a taboo for that in the moment, but I have lived for a very long time with this idea, in this commonly accepted taboo, civilisational taboo, about this*| *|  about all that happens with the woman. |*| 15 | (...) |*| 16 | R: In practice, the more you live through, the more people you meet, the more you start succeeding in building your own world*| *|  to destroy all, with which you have started, imposed by somebody, and to create your own views and opinions about things. Actually, the more people I have been with, never mind if I follow the model of my brother and father or not, the more I have managed to realize some things about the relations between men and women and to differentiate between what has been imposed on me, subconsciously, for such a long time, from outside*| *|   |*| 17 | (...) |*| 18 | R: Many girls started suffering from anorexia, and this is not something abnormal, especially for problematic families it is normal, the girl, who*| *|  In some ways, it is strange that boys do not have their anorexia and bulimia. The girls have these illnesses because this is something internal, as in the metaphor with the sexual organs, girls take everything inside. And actually I was missing some kind of a stability inside the family, something, to which I can hold on, never mind if it is good or bad, and it is not like I have grown up on the streets begging or in the most horrible environment. The lack of this attention from my parents has made me cope with things by myself, but I have not been clear about it because after all I was a child, so I had to cope with things based on what I was seeing in advertisements and on TV. Because where else can you get this information? There was one book at home called “A Book for the Woman,” which was a socialist book from 50 years ago. The only thing that I remember from it is something like “masturbation leads to marginalization.” And that girls who masturbate are expelled from society, that it is something trashy and really bad and I am not completely sure that this idea has disappeared from me. Because in this age, during this maturing, you leave behind the children’s things and you start slowly walking towards adulthood. That is why it is very important what you will see and what will get in your head, since this is what you will keep for your adult life. Years may pass before you realize that what you kept from this period is wrong. That is it, years have to pass, you have to live through different things, different situations, different relationships, and different people, so that you can realize that what you had as concepts initially is not what you believe in yourself and is not right for you, and you just have to leave it eventually.  |

The father – drives the car, makes the money and changes the light bulbs, and is powerful and responsible and defends everybody, and the mother in the normal families should be a real woman, use make up, know things about cosmetics, go to depilation, have manicure, look good, cook and clean the house and take care of the family. And actually I started noticing that my family is precisely the opposite – my father stayed at home all the time, after all that happened. He stopped working and was just staying at home and cooking. My mother was driving the car because my father had problems with the eyes, and she was making all the money in the family. She used to have and still has very rough hands, which are not like a woman’s hands, and she has never gone to manicure, she does not use cosmetics; I cannot use her clothes because they are not too feminine; or at least that is what I thought before. And in some ways*| *|  and my brother, he was supposed to take care of me as in all “normal” families the bigger brother takes care of you and defends you. In my family, my brother was not there and was very problematic, and everybody had to take care of him.  |*| 3 | (*| *| ) |*| 4 | R: And actually many, many years, many, many, really, at least 10, I was blaming my brother and my father. I was not blaming them that much in the beginning, but then I started to think that I have some kind of a problem with them and that is why all the relationships that I have had have been some kind of a consequence of this problem, and I have always needed the male authority, like society has imposed it on me, that the man is powerful, takes the right decisions, he is not weak, does not fall in depressions, does not need help, he helps, he has everything on his back. I have always lacked all of this and all my consequent relationships with men have been an affirmation or a negation of my brother or my father. It was the model of the weak, misunderstood boy, who is very emotional and needs my help, in whom I see my brother. Or the model of the pensive, absent intellectual, who does not show his emotions and whose emotions I have to bring out and to whom I have to prove myself, so that he shows that he loves me, which is the model of my father.  |*| 5 | (*| *| ) |*| 6 | R: And actually, at one point I realized that I have to accept that there are no definite characteristics of the man and the woman and that in some ways I have not liked my mother as she is, I called her “the man in the family”, that she is the father in the family. |*| 7 | (*| *| ) |*| 8 | R: I have imposed this idea on myself, that this is the role of a woman (her mother), who does not behave like a woman, but like a man, and that is why I am constantly confused by that, I do not allow myself to be weak, emotional, vulnerable, although I am that way inside. I have imposed on myself the idea that I have to take up the male function, that I am a man and that I am responsible, that I will be determined, intelligent, and so on*| *|  |*| 9 | (*| *| ) |*| 10 | R: And actually at one point, under the influence of the book of the writer and dramatist Eve Ensler, the book is called “I am an emotional creature.” I was reading it precisely when this unpleasant situation with the love triangle occurred, and while I was reading it, I realized that I am a woman to the marrow of my bones. And the fact that I am intelligent has nothing to do with my gender, and the fact that I can be determined and responsible has nothing to do with my gender, and that I do not give myself a chance to be what I am – emotional and sensitive.  |*| 11 | (*| *| ) |*| 12 | R: But in every encounter with a man, with people from the male gender, as in the beginning these were my father and brother, and the consequent encounters with men, not even once have I had the feeling of a person, who can take the decision instead of me, will be responsible instead of me, and in some ways I have worked up myself against men, subconsciously, and I have said to myself, they are stupid, weak, they do not think of other people, etc. |*| 13 | (*| *| ) |*| 14 | R:*| *|  as in some way my mother was not in this role, at least not in my world, she was in the role of something else. I could not take an example from her; she did not give me a possibility to understand what it means to be a woman.  |
